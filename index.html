By the author of With Your Crooked Heart.</p><p>Helen Dunmore has published nine novels with Penguin: Zennor in Darkness, which won the McKitterick Prize; Burning Bright; A Spell of Winter, which won the Orange Prize; Talking to the Dead; Your Blue-Eyed Boy; With Your Crooked Heart; The Siege, which was shortlisted for the 2001 Whitbread Novel of the Year Award and for the Orange Prize for Fiction 2002; Mourning Ruby and House of Orphans. She is also a poet, children&#x2019;s novelist and short-story writer.Unsettling love and stifled horror create and then destroy the claustrophobic world of this lush, literary gothic set in turn-of-the-century England. Catherine and Rob Allen, siblings two years apart, grow up in a world of shameful secrets. Their mother creates a public outcry, abandoning her family for a bohemian life on the Continent. Their father, whose mental state always has been slightly precarious, is committed to an asylum in the country. The children are sealed off with their grandfather in a crumbling country estate accompanied by their sturdy and well-loved servant, Kate, and the predatory tutor, Miss Gallagher. In true gothic fashion, terror, violence and eroticism collect beneath every dark surface. Against this strange and secretive backdrop, Cathy and Rob develop a closeness so fierce that it eventually threatens to smother them both. Kate makes the first crack in their hermetically sealed world, which World War I eventually bursts wide open. With Kate's departure for Canada and Rob's for the front, destitute times at home force Cathy into self-reliance. It's only after she's redeemed by hardship that she's given a second chance to be redeemed by love. Though the setting is classic gothic, the novel is peculiarly modern with its precise, unforgiving depictions of childhood and madness, its dark sensuality and surprising, artful use of metaphor. The intensity and darkness of the world Dunmore creates teeters between gripping and overwrought; some may find the story heavy-handed. Still, Dunmore's keen, close writing is deserving of Britain's prestigious Orange Prize, which the novel won when it was first published in the U.K. in 1995, and most will enjoy the book as a finely crafted, if disturbing, literary page-turner. (Feb.)Forecast: Dunmore's stock has been steadily rising with the publication in the U.S. of her last three novels (Your Blue-Eyed Boy; Talking to the Dead; With Your Crooked Heart); demand for this earlier, career-establishing work should be strong. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Sense of Order: A Study in the Psychology of Decorative Art</h2><p>Investigates the psychology of decorative design and the creation and function of formal orders concentrating on problems of decorative theory, visual perception, and the symbolism of design</p><p>Sir Ernst Gombrich was one of the greatest and least conventional art historians of his age, achieving fame and distinction in three separate spheres: as a scholar, as a popularizer of art, and as a pioneer of the application of the psychology of perception to the study of art. His best-known book, The Story of Art - first published 50 years ago and now in its 16th edition - is one of the most influential books ever written about art. His books further include Art and Illusion(1979) and The Preference for the Primitive (2002), as well as a total of 11 volumes of collected essays and reviews. Gombrich was born in Vienna in 1909 and died in London in November 2001. He came to London in 1936 to work at the Warburg Institute, where he eventually became Director from 1959 until his retirement in 1976. He won numerous international honours, including a knighthood, the Order of Merit and the Goethe, Hegel and Erasmus prizes. Gifted with a powerful mind and prodigious memory, he was also an outstanding communicator, with a clear and forceful prose style. His works are models of good art-historical writing, and reflect his humanism and his deep and abiding concern with the standards and values of our cultural heritage.&#39;It would be hard to imagine a more intelligent discussion of the natural history of decoration and ornament.&#39; (Jonathan Miller, The Sunday Times)</p><h2>Gun Digest 2016</h2><p><p>THE 70TH EDITION OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST GUN BOOK!</p><p>Firearm enthusiasts and shooting sportsmen everywhere recognize <i>Gun Digest</i> as the leading source for information on the latest guns and related gear.

Based on surviving accounts of soldiers and civilians, the author weaves together the compelling story of the fight for the Continental capital.<p>In the winter of 1777, after the victories at Trenton and Princeton, George Washington painstakingly rebuilt the Continental Army. The following spring, all eyes turned to the British commander-in-chief, Sir William Howe, to see when and where he would resume the drive on the rebel capital. Numerous skirmishes and seemingly pointless maneuvers finally led to Pennsylvania. The two main armies finally clashed in the bloody Battle of Brandywine on September 11, where Howe's flanking tactics inflicted a serious defeat on Washington. Rallying his forces, Washington resumed his defense of Philadelphia, only to be thwarted at the Schuylkill and suffer a small but bloody defeat at Paoli. Congress fled the capital as the British Army approached, and the campaign to win the hearts and minds of the American people raged in full fury as the two armies marched through the region.</p></p><p>Thomas McGuire teaches American history at Malvern Preparatory School near Paoli, Pennsylvania, and is the author of Battle of Paoli and Stop The Revolution."The text is filled with intriguing details that contribute to understanding the personnel and military units involved. ... Recommended." --Choice, October 2007.<br><br>The Philadelphia Campaign is first-rate, an absorbing work of tenacious research and close scholarship. Thomas J. McGuire knows the time of the American Revolution and has been over the ground in and about Philadelphia in a way few writers ever have. But it is his empathy for the human reality of war and the great variety of people caught up in it, whether in the service of the king or the Glorious Cause of America, that makes this book especially alive and memorable. --David McCullough, author of John Adams and 1776</p><h2>Chillpreneur: The New Rules for Creating Success, Freedom, and Abundance on Your Terms</h2><p><b><b>Feeling burned out by your business?

Almost lost, this book compiles ten years of research by the editor/author that explains the technology used. Understandable to the laymen and useful to the most advanced researcher, the physics of sympathetic vibrations is the unification of many different scientific, engineering and philosophical disciplines into a new paradigm. This science demonstrates the commonality that underlies all phenomena vibration! This book will be fascinating to both laymen and the most advanced scientists. Maybe you will be the one to be able to duplicate some of the incredible machines that John Keely developed which were all but lost for a hundred years. This monumental work contains the mathematics and basic principles which can usher in a new awareness as well as new sources of energy.</p><p>This book contains a vast collection of material on Keely and his work. In it has been included all the pictures and charts known to exist as of this date. I have also included all that we have been able to decipher of this wonderful new science and philosophy. There will be more discoveries and these will be published at a later date. The discoveries mentioned here demonstrate that Keely&#39;s science of Sympathetic Vibratory Physics is a wholistic approach to science and nature and reveals a wonderful order and simplicity. It is hoped readers will find a number of ideas and methods in these pages which they can apply to their current scientific work and research.The physics of sympathetic vibrations is the unification of many different scientific, engineering and philosophical disciplines into a new paradigm.

Their showdown in Reykjavik, Iceland, held the world spellbound for two months with reports of psychological warfare, ultimatums, political intrigue, cliffhangers, and farce to rival a Marx Brothers film. </p><p>Thirty years later, David Edmonds and John Eidinow, authors of the national bestseller Wittgenstein's Poker, have set out to reexamine the story we recollect as the quintessential cold war clash between a lone American star and the Soviet chess machine -- a machine that had delivered the world title to the Kremlin for decades. Drawing upon unpublished Soviet and U.S. records, the authors reconstruct the full and incredible saga, one far more poignant and layered than hitherto believed. </p><p>Against the backdrop of superpower politics, the authors recount the careers and personalities of Boris Spassky, the product of Stalin's imperium, and Bobby Fischer, a child of post-World War II America, an era of economic boom at home and communist containment abroad. The two men had nothing in common but their gift for chess, and the disparity of their outlook and values conditioned the struggle over the board. </p><p>Then there was the match itself, which produced both creative masterpieces and some of the most improbable gaffes in chess history. And finally, there was the dramatic and protracted off-the-board battle -- in corridors and foyers, in back rooms and hotel suites, in Moscow offices and in the White House. </p><p>The authors chronicle how Fischer, a manipulative, dysfunctional genius, risked all to seize control of the contest as the organizers maneuvered frantically to save it -- under the eyes of the world's press. They can now tell the inside story of Moscow's response, and the bitter tensions within the Soviet camp as the anxious and frustrated apparatchiks strove to prop up Boris Spassky, the most un-Soviet of their champions -- fun-loving, sensitive, and a free spirit. Edmonds and Eidinow follow this careering, behind-the-scenes confrontation to its climax: a clash that displayed the cultural differences between the dynamic, media-savvy representatives of the West and the baffled, impotent Soviets. Try as they might, even the KGB couldn't help.</p><p>A mesmerizing narrative of brilliance and triumph, hubris and despair, <em>Bobby Fischer Goes to War</em> is a biting deconstruction of the Bobby Fischer myth, a nuanced study on the art of brinkmanship, and a revelatory cold war tragicomedy. </p></p><p><p>David Edmonds is an award-winning journalists with the BBC. He's the bestselling authors of <em>Bobby Fischer Goes to War</em> and <em>Wittgenstein&#x2019;s Poker</em>.</p>Screwy, abrasive Bobby Fischer's 1972 triumph over chess champ Boris Spassky is depicted here in a political and psychological context that transcends the game. The authors provide only as much chessboard strategy as needed to clarify their story, one that others have told many times before, but not quite in this way. Narrator Sam Tsoutsouvas adopts a kind of "time marches on" style that in other hands would have stomped the text to death. Yet he manages to keep it light and play the humor while laying back the more sensational passages. His handsome, barrel-chested voice is a delight to listen to.

First identified as valuable in the 1930s, when the whole notion of card collecting was still young, the T206 Wagner has remained the big score for collectors who have scoured card shows, flea markets, estate sales, and auctions for the portrait of baseball's greatest shortstop. </p><p>Only a few dozen T206 Wagners are known to still exist. Most, with their creases, stains, and dog-eared corners, look worn and tattered, like they've been around for almost a century. But one&#x2014;The Card&#x2014;appears to have defied the travails of time. Thanks to its sharp corners and its crisp portrait of Honus Wagner, The Card has become the most famous and desired baseball card in the world.</p><p>Over the decades, as The Card has changed hands, its value has skyrocketed. It was initially sold for $25,000 by a small card shop in a nondescript strip mall. Years later, hockey great Wayne Gretzky bought it at the venerable Sotheby's auction house for $451,000. Then, more recently, it sold for $1.27 million on eBay. Today worth over $2 million, it has transformed a sleepy hobby into a billion-dollar industry that is at times as lawless as the Wild West. The Card has made men wealthy, certainly, but it has also poisoned lifelong friendships and is fraught with controversy&#x2014;from its uncertain origins and the persistent questions about its provenance to the possibility that it is not exactly as it seems. </p><p>Now for the first time, award-winning investigative reporters Michael O'Keeffe and Teri Thompson follow the trail of The Card from a Florida flea market to the hands of the world's most prominent collectors. They delve into a world of counterfeiters and con men and look at the people who profit from what used to be a kids' pastime, as they bring to light ongoing investigations into sports collectibles. O'Keeffe and Thompson also examine the life of the great Honus Wagner, a ballplayer whose accomplishments have been eclipsed by his trading card, and the strange and fascinating subculture of sports memorabilia and its astonishing decline.</p><p>Intriguing and eye-opening, <em>The Card</em> is a ground-breaking look at a uniquely American hobby.</p></p><p><p>Michael O'Keeffe is an award-winning journalist who is a member of the New York <em>Daily News</em> sports investigation team.

She and General Willard were on the Gamble&#x2019;s small bridge, where Captain Denlan and Lieutenant Esrai occupied the pilot&#x2019;s and copilot&#x2019;s seats. They had just exited hyperspace, the starfield steadying in the viewport as the ship slowed to sublight speed.<br><br>Captain Denlan said, &#x201c;If we&#x2019;d been a little later taking off, or if our hyperdrive hadn&#x2019;t been tuned just right, we would have missed it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, we didn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Leia said, more sharply than she had intended. If only the Rebel Alliance could have afforded to equip all its ships with the comm equipment necessary to receive hyperwave transmissions, this vulnerable moment could have been avoided. Still, so far the mission had gone as planned. There was no reason she should be on edge like this . . . but she was. At least, she told herself, they wouldn&#x2019;t have to wait around for long.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just glad fleet command got the time conversion right,&#x201d; Esrai said, her hands making quick adjustments to the control board. &#x201c;That would have been embarrassing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Embarrassing is one word for it,&#x201d; General Willard commented. He was standing next to Leia&#x2019;s comm station, his attention on the percentage-complete bar on the download screen. He was a tall, spare human with short graying hair, and Leia knew him well enough to see that he was uneasy as well. &#x201c;Princess?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We have it.&#x201d; Leia turned her chair around to face the computer console and checked the log to make certain the entire message had been recorded. It had. Now they just needed to decode the transmitted coordinates and program the jump to the meeting where they were to negotiate the purchase of raw materials for the construction of Echo Base, the new secret headquarters of the Rebel Alliance.<br><br>With the base so near to completion, the last couple of months hadn&#x2019;t been easy. So many things had gone wrong, and the Alliance was dangerously short on resources. Leia would allow herself to breathe a little easier only when this mission was over and the materials secured.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re done here,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Captain&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wait.&#x201d; Esrai&#x2019;s voice was sharp. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a sensor contact. It&#x2019;s pretty far out but&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>So much for breathing easier. Every nerve in Leia&#x2019;s body told her something had just gone terribly wrong. They were in the Mid Rim, at the farthest edge of an uninhabited system called Eschaton. With nothing more than a scatter of cold barren planets and one glowing ball of a striped blue gas giant, the system should have drawn little to no traffic; there was no reason for any other ships to be here. She snapped, &#x201c;Take us into hyperspace&#x2014;now!&#x201d;<br><br>She started to turn her seat forward. Then something hit her from behind and slammed her into the console. The safety straps ground painfully into her chest. Her ears rang and her eyes watered; heat washed against her neck. A heartbeat later she realized it had been a blast impact.<br><br>She twisted around to see Denlan and Esrai slumped over their consoles. The controls sparked with stray energy, the metal blackened with the force of the blast, and smoke streamed into the air. Leia fumbled for the straps with numb fingers, opened the buckles, and pushed to her feet. She took a step forward and fell to her knees. She landed next to General Willard, who had been thrown into the base of the comp-console.<br><br>She said his name aloud but couldn&#x2019;t hear her own voice. Her ears still rang with the ship&#x2019;s alarm klaxons, strangely distant. The general&#x2019;s face was bloody and his eyes were closed, but as she put her hand on his chest she felt him breathe. She gasped in relief, then grabbed her chair and pulled herself upright again.<br><br>Through the viewport, all she saw was a wheeling starfield; the ship was in an uncontrolled tumble. Every readout on the bridge was either redlined, blinking in an emergency setting, or blank. She stumbled to the pilot&#x2019;s seat and gripped Denlan&#x2019;s shoulder. She started to pull him up off the sparking console and then froze, her stomach twisting. The control panel directly in front of him had exploded and blown a hole in his chest. Gritting her teeth, she let him go and turned to Esrai, who was slumped over sideways. Leia felt for a pulse at the lieutenant&#x2019;s throat, and her hand came away slick with blood. Dreading what she would see, she lifted Esrai&#x2019;s hair aside. There was shrapnel embedded in her temple. Esrai&#x2019;s dark eyes were open but fixed, dead.<br><br>Leia squeezed her own eyes shut, willing her stomach not to turn. Then the deck thumped and shuddered under her, and she grabbed the back of the copilot&#x2019;s seat. They were still taking fire. She looked for the sensor screen to get some idea of where their attacker was.<br><br>One of her ears popped, and the din of klaxons grew louder. But one alarm was close at hand and particularly insistent. It came from one of the few functioning readouts on the command panel and showed a rapidly dropping percentage. bridge containment shield failing, Leia read, and her gaze went to the viewport. There was a deep, ragged crack in the lower quarter.<br><br>Leia swore and lunged across the bridge. She hit the release on the hatch and leaned down to grab Willard. The only reason she wasn&#x2019;t breathing vacuum right now was that the containment shield had automatically covered the port when it detected the breach; she didn&#x2019;t know how long until it failed, but the alarm suggested that could happen at any moment.<br><br>She pulled Willard into a sitting position and then realized the hatch wasn&#x2019;t open. She stood and hit the release again. No response.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, you have to be joking,&#x201d; Leia snarled, and popped open the plate for the manual release. The containment-shield warning screamed in her ears as she pulled the lever for the manual override. She felt the hatch&#x2019;s locking mechanism click, but it still didn&#x2019;t slide open. She dug her fingers between the seals, braced a boot against the comp-console, and put all her strength into dragging the doors open.<br><br>Slowly the hatch moved until she had just enough clearance to force her shoulders through. From the increasingly frantic shrieks of the containment alarm, she didn&#x2019;t have time for any more. She leaned down, clutched the back of the general&#x2019;s jacket, and started to pull his unconscious body through the opening.<br><br>Right at the point where she thought she was going to get both of them stuck and they were going to not only die, but die in an extremely undignified position, she heard boot steps pound toward her from the corridor.<br><br>&#x201c;Here!&#x201d; Leia yelled, her voice sounding harsh and desperate to her own ears.<br><br>A crew member appeared in the compartment door, took in the situation, and lunged forward. She grabbed General Willard under the arms and threw her weight backward. Leia lifted his legs and squeezed through and out of the bridge, then pointed toward the compartment blast door. &#x201c;Hurry, the hatch won&#x2019;t seal, no time&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>She knew her words were coming out incoherent, but the woman understood her. Together they dragged the general across the compartment and out into the corridor. As soon as they were clear, Leia dropped his legs and flung herself on the door control to hit the emergency seal. It slid shut just as the containment alarm shrieked one last time, then abruptly went silent. Leia felt a rumble and a thump through the metal as the bridge&#x2019;s port gave way.<br><br>Breathing hard, the woman asked, &#x201c;The captain and Esrai are dead?&#x201d; She was a tall human, with dark brown skin and braided dark hair pulled tightly back. She would have been lovely except for the haggard worry in her expression. Her nose was bleeding and the skin around her eyes was bruised, as if she&#x2019;d had a face-first encounter with a console or a bulkhead.<br><br>Leia nodded. &#x201c;When the first blast hit.&#x201d; The deck rumbled under her feet, a vibration from a near-miss blast impact. They needed to get the ship away. There was a comm panel near the hatch, and she pushed the all-ship alert. &#x201c;Han Solo! Han, can you hear me?&#x201d;<br><br>At first the only reply was the rumble of the firefight. Then another comm answered. She heard yelling in the background and a voice said, &#x201c;He&#x2019;s operating the guns with Barani, Your Highness. Are you all right? The bulkhead doors to the upper deck are down, we can&#x2019;t get to you&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>That was all Leia needed, the pilot most experienced at this sort of desperate situation locked out of the control deck. &#x201c;The bridge is depressurized,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to engage auxiliary control and take the ship into hyperspace. Just try to hold them off a little longer.&#x201d; She had no idea who &#x201c;they&#x201d; even were, though it was safe to assume it was an Imperial ship. She didn&#x2019;t want to admit over the open comm that she hadn&#x2019;t even gotten a glimpse of their attacker yet.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, Your Highness,&#x201d; the voice said, and Leia heard him yell, &#x201c;She said to keep shooting!&#x201d; before the comm switched into standby.<br><br>&#x201c;We need to get to auxiliary control.&#x201d; Leia hesitated, looking down at Willard&#x2019;s inert body; he was breathing, and there was nothing she could do for him until the ship was out of danger. She started down the corridor, the other woman following. Leia wanted to run, but the deck rolled underfoot, a sign that the grav controls were beginning to fail.<br><br>She looked at her companion. &#x201c;You&#x2014;&#x201d; The woman wasn&#x2019;t wearing any insignia; because of the mission, no one aboard was wearing anything that might identify them as Rebel Alliance, and most were dressed in plain fatigues or as civilian spacers. But Leia vaguely remembered seeing her in the Independence&#x2019;s fighter bay. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a pilot? Can you fly this ship?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m an X-wing pilot. I&#x2019;ve flown slow cargo transports, airspeeders, but&#x2014;I&#x2019;ll try.&#x201d;<br><br>That was all Leia could ask for at the moment. The Gamble was a small converted freighter with a crew of twenty, no fighters, but far more quad lasers than its size and cargo space warranted. The conversion and installation of the extra armament had left the ship&#x2019;s corridors narrow and the layout a maze. Esrai had said the controls were as jury-rigged and altered as the rest of the ship, and Leia&#x2019;s vision was starting to blur. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, I don&#x2019;t remember your name&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>The deck pitched and threw them both into the bulkhead. The other woman took hold of Leia&#x2019;s arm and, pushing off with her free hand against the wall, towed her down the corridor. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Sian Tesar. I was down in engineering when you came aboard.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, good. I always try to meet the entire crew, so I don&#x2019;t have to ask someone if she&#x2019;s a pilot while we&#x2019;re in the middle of a firefight.&#x201d; Leia was dizzy, and her head was pounding.<br><br>They reached the shaft that led to the auxiliary control, and the gravity held on just long enough for them to climb down and into the little cabin. There was no viewport, just a screen for the sensor data. It was blank, hopefully only because the controls were powered down.<br><br>Punching in the command override to transfer control from what was left of the bridge, Leia held her breath. If this didn&#x2019;t work, they were dead. Everything seemed to hesitate; then readouts started to light up, and she breathed in relief.<br><br>Sian dragged herself into the pilot&#x2019;s seat and hit the master to power up the boards. She winced as the screens came to life. &#x201c;Our deflector shields are down, and we&#x2019;ve got turbolaser fire incoming. I can&#x2019;t see what&#x2019;s shooting at us.&#x201d;<br><br>Leia wrestled herself into the second chair and fastened the straps. &#x201c;If it was anything close to the size of a cruiser, this would be over by now.&#x201d; She powered up the navicomputer and was relieved to see that the hyperdrive was still there, at least for the moment. But capacity was down nearly 50 percent, she realized, checking the diagnostics screen. That&#x2019;s a problem. The blast that had sent such deadly energy through the bridge controls must have gone through the engine systems, too, meaning the Gamble couldn&#x2019;t jump directly back to the fleet. She also couldn&#x2019;t program a jump to the conference location, because the coordinates hadn&#x2019;t been decoded yet.<br><br>As Sian coaxed the sublight engines back online, Leia had the nav system check for valid coordinates nearby. They could look for a port later&#x2014;right now, they just needed to get away. She glanced at the screen just as the sensors caught an image of their attacker. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a light corvette,&#x201d; she told Sian. Which meant the Imperials hadn&#x2019;t known about this mission for long. If they had had the time, they would have sent something much bigger.<br><br>Sian swore and pushed the control yoke forward. &#x201c;If they get us in their tractor beam, they could board us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then don&#x2019;t let them get us in their tractor beam,&#x201d; Leia said, making her voice cool despite the pounding of her heart.<br><br>Sian flashed her a sudden grin, proving Leia&#x2019;s estimation of her correct. &#x201c;Can do.&#x201d;<br><br>As Sian turned their uncontrolled tumble into a deliberate spiral, Leia adjusted what was left of the shields to compensate for the failed sections and directed more sensor data to the screen. She had to fumble for controls that weren&#x2019;t where she expected them to be; fortunately Sian was a quicker study and seemed to adjust rapidly to the layout of the console. The ship shuddered again at a near miss; on the weapons screen Leia could see the Gamble&#x2019;s turbolasers still returning fire.<br><br>Sian put the ship through an evasive maneuver that made all the failing systems redline. She flew the converted heavy freighter like an X-wing, a strategy that Leia highly approved of, even though it was probably the only way Sian knew to fly. Then suddenly the ship swung out of the corvette&#x2019;s kill zone and into a clear starfield.<br><br>&#x201c;Come on, come on,&#x201d; Leia muttered, glancing at the navicomputer. The alert pinged as it finally fixed on a set of coordinates. She confirmed them and configured the jump, narrowing her eyes in concentration, trying to think past the aching pain in her head and make sure she didn&#x2019;t tell the computer to drop them into a star. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going into hyperspace,&#x201d; she said, and slid the control levers down.<br><br>Leia felt the engines stutter; then sudden power surged through the ship and the starfield blurred into streaks of light.<br><br>The readouts jumped between redline and normal, then finally settled on a range Leia interpreted as &#x201c;not great but not likely to explode anytime soon.&#x201d; She slumped back and put her pounding skull gently against the worn headrest. That was the kind of excitement she could have lived without.<br><br>Sian let out a long breath. &#x201c;We made it.&#x201d; She glanced at Leia. &#x201c;Sort of.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sort of,&#x201d; Leia agreed grimly.<br><br>While Sian went to see if she could get the blocked blast doors open to the lower decks, Leia took a moment to find a data card in the supply case in the auxiliary control locker. She checked the navicomputer and saw it had the transmission, copied over from the main console in the bridge when she had transferred control here. She saved the transmission to the data card and then deleted the original from the system.<br><br>The comm was starting to buzz with reports of wounded. The Gamble had a small medical unit and a medic, whom Leia hoped could handle the injuries until they could get to a safe facility with a medical droid.<br><br>And she needed to find out who had told the Imperials where the Gamble would be coming out of hyperspace. It was tempting to think that the intel could have come from somewhere in Kearn-sa&#x2019;Davit&#x2019;s organization. He was the Alliance agent who had arranged the meeting with the traders with whom she was to negotiate. But Leia knew the leak was far more likely to have come from someone in the Rebel Alliance&#x2019;s chain of communication. She rubbed her eyes wearily. This could be...</p><h2>God According to God: A Physicist Proves We&#39;ve Been Wrong About God All Along</h2><p><p>&#x201c;This is as important a book on this subject as I recall ever having read.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014; Huston Smith</p><p>&#x201c;Brilliant.... Schroeder&#x2019;s book demands the attention of anyone who wonders if God must be exiled from the modern, enlightened mind.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014; David J. Wolpe, author of <em>Why Faith Matters</em> </p><p>In his first book since 2002&#x2019;s acclaimed <em>The Hidden Face of God</em>, popular scientist Gerald Schroeder combines decades of scientific research and biblical study to present a groundbreaking new paradigm of how to understand God. Readers of Jack Miles&#x2019; <em>God: A Biography</em>, Francis Collins&#x2019;s <em>The Language of God</em>, and Richard Friedman&#x2019;s <em>Who Wrote the Bible</em> will find much to contemplate in <em>God According to God</em>.</p></p><p><p>In this groundbreaking exploration, a biblical scholar and M.I.T.-trained physicist combines decades of research to change the debate between religion and science, presenting a new paradigm of how to understand God.</p><p>Gerald Schroeder has spent his career revealing the hand of God in the intricate discoveries of physics. Now, for the first time, he turns his attention to this force, examining both the Bible and the physical world to discover the true nature of God&#x2014;God according to God. </p><p>Schroeder argues that we have ignored those traits of God we find unappealing, replacing them with our personal desire for the all-knowing, all-loving, never-changing deity that so many worship today. This leads to the age-old problem: How can there be such a God when the world is filled with tragedy? Yet Schroeder reveals that this troubling juxtaposition is really smoke and mirrors. The God revealed in the Bible is 100 percent compatible with the world as we know it today. It is our misconception of God that causes the disparity. In fact, the concept of God that atheists rail against and that believers defend is inaccurate. </p><p>In <em>God According to God</em>, Schroeder presents a compelling case for the true God, a dynamic God who is still learning how to relate to creation. The key to God's action in the world, according to Schroeder, can be found in a well-known verse in Exodus that is typically translated "I am that which I am." Schroeder's correction that it should be translated "I will be that which I will be" reveals a God that changes to fit the ever-changing world. </p><p>This opens our eyes to other characteristics of God that we have long overlooked despite their being present in some of the most popular stories in the Bible&#x2014;a God who regrets (the flood of Noah), a God who wants us to argue with Him (Jacob wrestling with God in the desert), and thus a God who changes His mind (Moses convinces God to spare the Israelite people), and a God who allowed nature, and the creation itself, from the very start, to rebel (Adam's and Eve's betrayal in Eden).</p><p>With riveting chapters on the origins of life, a scientist's view of creation, and the unique place of our planet in the galaxy, <em>God According to God</em> offers a radical paradigm shift that will forever change how we understand God. </p><p>Gerald L. Schroeder is the author of <em>The Science of God</em>, <em>The Hidden Face of God</em>, and <em>Genesis and the Big Bang</em>.

This volume, set in the early days of Fabletown, long before the FABLES series began, featuring sequences illustrated by Charles Vess, Brian Bolland, John Bolton, Michael Wm. Kaluta, James Jean, Mark Buckingham, Jill Thompson and more, 1,001 NIGHTS OF SNOWFALL is both an entry point to the critically acclaimed series and an essential part of Willingham&#39;s enchanting and imaginative FABLES mythos.Traveling in Arabia as an Ambassador from the exiled FABLES community, Snow White is captured by the local sultan who wants to marry her (and then kill her). But the clever Snow attempts to charm the sultan instead by playing Scheherazade, telling him fantastic stories for a total of 1,001 nights. Running the gamut from horror to dark intrigue to mercurial coming-of-age, FABLES:1,001 NIGHTS OF SNOWFALL reveals the secret histories of familiar FABLES characters through a series of compelling and visually illustrative tales.</p><p>Bill Willingham is a writer and artist whose work includes Fables, Day of Vengeance, The Elementals, Coventry and The Sandman Presents: The Thessaliad. Brian Bolland has drawn Judge Dredd, Batman: The Killing Joke, and many covers. Charles Vess is one of the artists of Sandman and also drew Neil Gaiman&#39;s Stardust. Mark Buckingham has worked on many titles, including Death: The Time of Your Life, Batman: Shadow of the Bat, Fables and Hellblazer.<i>Starred Review.</i> Probably the smartest mainstream comic going, <i>Fables</i> usually concentrates on the contemporary activities of characters from children's stories who now are living as secret refugees in New York. This collection gives glimpses of their individual backstories before the armies of the brutal Adversary drove them out of Fairyland. Readers will learn, for example, what spoiled the Big Bad Wolf's disposition and what happened to the witch <i>after</i> Hansel and Gretel pushed her into the oven. It would be relatively easy to do clever, merely cynical readings of the fairy tales, but Willingham is after something much more interesting. Like Neil Gaiman and Tanith Lee, he's reimagining the old stories, trying to see why they have survived and also to point out the aspects they somehow neglect: it's only natural that Snow White would take revenge on the seven little rapists who abducted her, but the independent way she goes about it casts doubt on her subservient relationship to Prince Charming. Willingham reminds readers of how much they ignore in their anxiety to believe that all stories end happily ever after. Artists like Charles Vess, Mark Buckingham and Jill Thompson work up to the level of the perceptive scripts, making this a memorable, uncomfortably amusing treat. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Also included is an introduction by Herbert describing his personal feelings about the filming of David Lynch&#39;s movie version of Dune; Herbert&#39;s own favorite short story, Seed Stock and tales from throughout his career, some never before collected.</p><p><b>Frank Herbert</b> was born in Tacoma, Washington, and educated at the University of Washington, Seattle. He worked a wide variety of jobs--including TV cameraman, radio commentator, oyster diver, jungle survival instructor, lay analyst, creative writing teacher, reporter and editor of several West Coast newspapers--before becoming a full-time writer. He died in 1986.After three fine collections celebrating SF greats Arthur C. Clarke, Fritz Leiber and Philip Jose Farmer, Preiss's Masterworks of SF &amp; Fantasy series hits a snag here. Herbert is one of the biggest names in the field but his best work has been of novel length (Dune, Hellstrom's Hive, etc.). While some of the themes of those books reappear here, the stories are generally mediocre because Herbert lacks the space for adequate background and characterization to make us care. Only the short "Seed Stock," about colonizing an alien world, delves beneath the plot mechanics. This collection might have been redeemed if, like the previous volumes, it had included a long autobiographical essay. In its place, however, is a short, weak defense of the movie version of Dune.

M. Stanley's famous 1874 expedition in which he mapped the Congo River. When Daily Telegraph correspondent Tim Butcher was sent to Africa in 2000 he quickly became obsessed with the legendary Congo River and the idea of re-creating Stanley's legendary journey along the three-thousand-mile waterway. Despite warnings that his plan was suicidal, Butcher set out for the Congo's eastern border with just a rucksack and a few thousand dollars hidden in his boots. Making his way in an assortment of vehicles, including a motorbike and a dugout canoe, helped along by a cast of characters from UN aid workers to a pygmy-rights advocate, he followed in the footsteps of the great Victorian adventurers. An utterly absorbing narrative that chronicles Tim Butcher's forty-four-day journey along the Congo River, <i>Blood River</i> is an unforgettable story of exploration and survival.</p><p>"A masterpiece." - John Le Carr� <br> "A remarkable, fascinating book by a courageous and perceptive writer. One of the most exciting books to emerge from Africa in recent years."-- Alexander McCall Smith, bestselling author of <i>The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency</i><br> "Tim Butcher deserves a medal for this crazy feat.

It takes a lot of guts to yomp through the Congo and he obviously has plenty of those. But it is the wit and passion of the writing which keeps you engrossed."--Giles Foden, author of <i>The Last King of Scotland</i><br> "Blood River represents a remarkable marriage of travelogue and history, which deserves to make Tim Butcher a star for his prose, as well as his courage." --Max Hastings, author of <i>Armageddon: The Battle for Germany</i><br> "The day of the solitary intrepid traveler is not over. Tim Butcher's extraordinary, audacious journey through the Congo is worthy of the great 19th century explorers. Completely enthralling but also a thoughtful and sobering portrait of modern Africa." --William Boyd, author of <i>Restless</i><br> "The Congo is one of the most dangerous and unpredictable countries on earth, and to have penetrated into the depths of its darkness and described it so fully is a great achievement. It even left me with ore of an affection for Stanley than I have ever felt before.

On March 25th we left Benton Barracks for the front. We marched through St. Louis and onto the steamboat that day, but from some cause I never knew, the boat did not leave the wharf until about dark the next evening. My company was quartered on the hurricane deck of the boat. Soon after the boat started down the river an incident befell me that looks somewhat comical now, but at that time it was to me a serious matter, and one that troubled my conscience a good deal. I had piled my knapsack, with the blanket strapped on the outside, and my other stuff, at the foot of the gun stack which included my musket. Suddenly I discovered, to my great consternation, that.my blanket was gone! Yes, my lords and gentlemen, some "false Scot" had deliberately and feloniously appropriated my indispensable equipment for a night's repose. And a long, raw March night was coming on, and the damp and chilly air was rising, like a fog, from the cold surface of the river. All signs, too, portended a rainy night. The thunder was muttering off in the southwest, intermittent flashes of lightning lit up the sky, and scattering drops of rain were even then beginning to patter on the hurricane deck and ripple the bosom of the stream. What should I do? I must have a blanket, that was certain. But all my life the belief had been instilled into me that stealing was well-nigh the most disgraceful of all crimes, and that a thief was a most odious and contemptible wretch. Moreover, one pf the ten commandments "pintedly" declared. "Thou shalt not steal." But something had to be done, and speedily. At last it occurred to me that being a soldier, and belonging for the time being to Uncle Sam, I was a species of government property...</p><p></p><h2>The Browns of California: The Family Dynasty that Transformed a State and Shaped a Nation</h2><p><p><b>"Miriam Pawel&#x2019;s fascinating book . . . illuminates the sea change in the nation&#x2019;s politics in the last half of the 20th century."--<i>New York Times Book Review</i></b></p><p><b>California Book Award Gold Medal Winner * </b><b>Finalist for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize * A <i>Los Angeles Times </i>Bestseller * </b><b><i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>'s "Best Books of the Year" List * </b><b><i>Publishers Weekly </i></b><b>Top Ten History Books for Fall * </b><b><i>Berkeleyside </i>Best Books of the Year * </b><b>Shortlisted for NCIBA Golden Poppy Award</b><b></b><br><b></b><br><b>A Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning journalist's panoramic history of California and its impact on the nation, from the Gold Rush to Silicon Valley--told through the lens of the family dynasty that led the state for nearly a quarter century.</b></p><p>Even in the land of reinvention, the story is exceptional: Pat Brown, the beloved father who presided over California during an era of unmatched expansion; Jerry Brown, the cerebral son who became the youngest governor in modern times--and then returned three decades later as the oldest.</p><p>In <i>The Browns of California</i>, journalist and scholar Miriam Pawel weaves a narrative history that spans four generations, from August Schuckman, the Prussian immigrant who crossed the Plains in 1852 and settled on a northern California ranch, to his great-grandson Jerry Brown, who reclaimed the family homestead one hundred forty years later.

To bring this four-generation story together, Pawel consulted archives across the state and conducted extensive interviews with Governor Brown, his family members, and longtime associates. As a result, the Brown family story is enlivened with densely textured settings and carefully selected vignettes . . . This is not a comprehensive California history disguised as political biography.

After her wonderful biography of Cesar Ch�vez, she masterfully writes about the influence of the Brown family in the transformation of California for more than a century. Pat and Jerry Brown, both, became governors. But theirs is not your typical political family. The letters and exchanges between Jerry, the seminarian, and Pat, the governor, are fascinating, insightful and provocative. This book wisely demonstrates that in California you can shape your own future and that second chances are real . . . if your family is behind you. <i>The Browns of California</i> is an essential book to understand how the United States is a country in perpetual creation." - <i>Jorge Ramos, Univision news anchor</i></p><p>"<i>The Crusades of Cesar Chavez</i> is a biography for readers who find real human beings more compelling than icons." - <i>Los Angeles Times</i></p><p>"Engrossing . . .

Here is the story of a man, from the humblest beginnings, who became a labor organizer as famous as any; here is a deeply flawed man who yearned to be a saint." - <i>Richard Rodriguez, author of DARLING: A Spiritual Autobiography and HUNGER OF MEMORY: The Education of Richard Rodriguez, on THE CRUSADES OF CESAR CHAVEZ</i></p><p>"<i>Guau!</i> Miriam Pawel has finally given us the Cesar Chavez we deserve: neither a saint nor a bully but a complex American activist who rose to the occasion with courage, astuteness, and intuition, but was also clumsy, misinformed, and nearsighted. Written in a beautifully nuanced style and displaying enviable depth of knowledge, <i>The Crusades of Cesar Chavez</i> is a masterpiece. Future biographies will be measured against it." - <i>Ilan Stavans, Amherst College, author of The United States of Mestizo</i></p><p>"This is a remarkable account of the life of Cesar Chavez and of his iconic struggle for justice for America's migrant farmworkers.

But Brown put his career on hold to be with the woman he loved&#x2014;American music royalty Whitney Houston. The marriage between Brown and Houston was perhaps the most closely watched and talked about marriage of the 1990s&#x2014;a pairing that obsessed the public and the gossip industry. Now, for the first time, the world will be able to hear the truth from the mouth of America&#x2019;s &#x201c;bad boy&#x201d; himself.&nbsp;Raw and powerful,&nbsp;<em>Every Little Step&nbsp;</em>is the story of a man who has been on the top of the mountain and in the depths of the valley and who is now finally ready to talk about his career and family life, from the passion and the excess to his creative inspirations and massive musical success.</p><p>On the process of writing this book, Bobby says, &#x201c;Right after I signed on to write my story, I went through one of the most agonizing traumas I had ever experienced with the death of my daughter. But I was surprised by how therapeutic it was to work on this project, to look at the entire arc of my life and to realize that although there has been considerable pain, I have also been incredibly blessed. I hope my fans and other readers of this book will be entertained by this trip into the crazy, exciting, fascinating world of Bobby Brown. And I hope they will feel that I have been as honest and open with them in these pages as I have tried to be my entire life.&#x201d;</p></p><p><p>Bobby Brown, the singer, dancer, and all-around amazing performer, first became famous at the age of fourteen as a part of the Boston group New Edition. But it was his solo career and the release of his 1988 album, Don&#x2019;t Be Cruel, with its chart-topping title track, as well as hit songs &#x201c;My Prerogative&#x201d; and &#x201c;Every Little Step,&#x201d; that made him infamous. As he toured the world, wowing fans, scoring hit after hit, earning millions, Brown found himself the fodder of tabloids. When he married the most celebrated singer in the world at the time, pop princess Whitney Houston, he began a life under a microscope. The couple&#x2019;s every move was tracked, and jaw-dropping stories were told about drug addiction, physical violence, and worse, with Brown always cast as the villain. Forever branded, Brown was trapped in a spiral of rage against the media and drug addiction, fighting for the will to get himself clean and keep his family together. </p><p>Now the man behind the misconceptions, rumors, and lies bares his soul. In this honest, raw, and at times heartbreaking account, Brown tells the truth of his life. <em>Every Little Step</em> is the story of a kid growing up in the projects of Boston, always on the move and always looking for an audience. Brown reveals what really happened when he left New Edition to launch his solo career and tales of his relationships with some of the most prominent pop divas in the world, including intimate details of his marriage to Houston that describe the purity of their love and the devastation he felt as it crumbled. Most poignantly, he finally speaks about losing his beloved daughter Bobbi Kristina. And through it all, Brown shows himself to be a family man, devoted to his children and his wife; a man who cared for both of his parents right up until their deaths; and a man who can admit where he faltered, but had the strength to stand up again.&nbsp; </p><p>I became famous with New Edition when I was just fourteen.</p><p>As a solo artist, I released an album before my twentieth birthday that many have noted as altering the course of R &amp; B music. In my twenties, I fell in love with the biggest music star on the planet. Our marriage kept more than a few gossip tabloids in business. </p><p>I am still trying to grapple with the incredible pain and trauma of losing my daughter.</p><p>But despite my three decades in the harsh media glare, the public has never really heard my story. What Bobby Brown is thinking, what he&#x2019;s doing, what he did do, what he didn&#x2019;t do.</p><p>Early on, I cemented my reputation as &#x201c;the bad boy of R &amp; B.&#x201d; And it stuck. But now that label feels too one-dimensional. I feel like I owe it to myself and the ones I love, and will always love, to be honest. </p>I want to tell the real story.Bobby Brown is a singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, and actor. He lives in Los Angeles, California, with his wife and children. Nick Chiles is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author or co-author of 14 books, including three New York Times bestsellers.

People love straw bale homes because they are so often extraordinarily beautiful and inviting.<br> In the past two decades, the bale-building renaissance has attracted some of our most gifted architects, artisan builders, and craftspeople. Certain qualities of straw as a material--and the hands-on process of constructing walls with a completely natural substance--have appealed to both very experienced builders and those who find this to be a uniquely accessible form of creating shelter. The characteristic thick walls and wide windowsills of straw bale houses, the possibility of incorporating curves and even arches, and the rousing experience of family "wall-raisings" have become well-known. Combined with older styles of plastering and earthen floors, these very contemporary buildings have a timeless quality that's easy to recognize yet hard to achieve with conventional manufactured materials.<br> These are buildings with personality--plus!<br> Athena and Bill Steen, co-authors of the original <i>Straw Bale House</i> book published by Chelsea Green in 1994, have now created a book that celebrates in gorgeous color photographs the tactile, sensuous beauty of straw bale dwellings. Their selection of photos also demonstrates how far bale building has come in a very short period of time: In addition to handsome homes, small and not-so-small, this book shows larger-scale institutional buildings, including schools, office buildings, the Solar Living Center, and a Save the Children center in Mexico.<br> In addition, this book includes an introductory essay by the Steens noting the key lessons they have learned in years of building with bales: insights into the design and construction process, and critical advice about design elements that ameliorate the impacts of moisture, weather, and wear-and-tear over time. Each photograph is also accompanied by narrative text highlighting a given building's special features and personal touches.</p><p><p>Bill Steen is a photographer and collaborative builder who is especially interested in combining building techniques with community-enhancing approaches to design. Athena and Bill are co-founders of the Canelo Project, through which they conduct ecological design and construction workshops in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. They live in Canelo, Arizona.

Is it complexity of design, square footage, or money spent? Is it the prominence of a "view-obsessed" starter castle on top of the hill? Or the prestige of having an architect's "showcase"? Perhaps beauty originates somewhere beyond all that, in elements more internal and more related to the human heart. Isn't beauty closer to the fullness you feel when sitting in a cozy corner? Or the feeling you have after working hard all day, then standing back to look at your work with a childlike pride? Beauty is more easily found in that which has been touched with love and care than in polished details and lavish furnishings.<br><br>For us, the most memorable houses have been small and simple, and those with which the owners have played an integral part. Many of these are not finely finished, nor are they examples of superb craftsmanship, but they are rich with character and ingenuity. All too often, homeowners relinquish to the architect and builder the opportunity to be personally involved in the creation of their home. From a distance, they monitor the building and the shaping of spaces they will one day inhabit. Someone else designs it, another person builds it, and in the end they are left with a house for which they did little else than pay. Most modern houses are not much more than purchased commodities that tell of our increasing dependence on specialists and our loss of ability to craft our own lives. Most such house are impersonal and empty of feeling. This is not to say that architects and builders don't have a place in the process of making homes, but simply that there is a tendency to over-rely on them.<br><br>Speed and efficiency dominate conventional building. The builder is expected to build as fast as possible for the least amount of money. Under those stressed circumstances, there is very little time or space for intimate creativity. To stay on schedule and within budget, it is presumed necessary to rely primarily on mass-produced industrial materials that don't encourage deviation from their intended use and that require the extensive use of power tools. The best-intentioned designers and builders find themselves confined to a narrow range of possibilities, and not surprisingly the results are often boring and predictable.<br><br>On the other hand, we have discovered in our own work that using natural and local materials encourages a very different way of building. these materials often have an inherent beauty that stands out without the need for complex forms and shapes. Lacking uniformity, rigidity, and angularity, they naturally lend themselves to soft, organic curves. They resonate with the textures and colors of their natural context, reminding us that the building belongs where it is placed. they are forgiving, and beg to be sculpted by hand or worked with simple tools, opening the door for more people to be involved in the process.<br><br>Although many houses built from natural materials are beautiful, the use of such materials does not guarantee that a house will be beautiful. We have seen many straw bale houses that feel no different than any other building. When incorporated into conventional construction, natural materials become subjugated to the same stresses and patterns. Straw bale walls can rapidly become a very insignificant part of the whole house. We once asked a friend how she liked her new house, and she responded, "I really wanted a straw bale home, but what I got was a house with straw bales in the walls." Her house was beautiful in the typical meaning of the word. It was well built and nicely finished. And yet it lacked the texture of her presence. Its abstract perfection kept everyone at a distance, including her.<br>The walls surrounding us day in and day out need to embrace us, our dreams and passions woven into their very fabric. They need to sing the story of who we are. Otherwise our houses will never become our homes. And it is in the depths of this magical transformation where genuine beauty lies.</p><h2>Dancing at Ciro&#39;s: A Family&#39;s Love, Loss, and Scandal on the Sunset Strip</h2><p>In 1958, young Sheila Weller was living a charmed life with her family in Beverly Hills. Her father was a brilliant and charismatic brain surgeon. Her mother was a movie-magazine writer whose brother owned Hollywood&#x2019;s most dazzling nightclub, Ciro&#x2019;s. Then Sheila Weller&#x2019;s world exploded. After she witnessed her uncle&#x2019;s frenzied physical assault on her father, a whole store of family secrets and dramas unfolded, rivaling those that transpired in the nightclub&#x2019;s dressing room and banquettes every night. <br><br>Weller has written a deeply felt memoir of her family&#x2019;s richly accomplished but ultimately tragic life, contrasted with those most glamorous days of Hollywood&#x2019;s golden era. While vividly describing Lana Turner&#x2019;s, Frank Sinatra&#x2019;s, and Sammy Davis Jr.&#x2019;s evenings---and breakdowns---at Ciro&#x2019;s, she captures a whole subgroup of American dreamers: the New York Jews who bounded from Brooklyn to Broadway and finally to Hollywood. They expected that success and proximity to glamour would erase centuries of anxiety and melancholy---but often discovered they&#x2019;d only found a higher ledge from which to fall.<br><br>Weller seamlessly weaves a history of the American nightclub into the saga of an unforgettable family that, while fatally flawed, is never whiny or &#x201c;dysfunctional.&#x201d; The dreamy grandeur of Hollywood in the forties and the dark tensions of the fifties come alive through the pages and through the characters, for whom love---and the very idea of family---is almost biblically tested, but never quite extinguished.<br></p><p>Veteran journalist Sheila Weller's childhood memoir is as starkly compelling as it is emotionally and historically complex, lifting the veil on a life of rarified privilege. Weller's father was a pioneering Los Angeles neurosurgeon, her mother the acclaimed Hollywood gossip columnist Helen Hover, and uncle Herman Hover owned Tinseltown's most famous nightspot, Ciro's. Nonetheless, Weller reveals a childhood haunted by dysfunction and denial, a hidden familial drama played out in the idyllic village that was Beverly Hills in the '40s and '50s, and one that segues to dark tragedy as it wends inexorably toward a final act scarred by scandal and life-shattering violence. Weller's richly detailed, emphatic prose skillfully interweaves ruminations on the phenomenon of American Jewish reinvention that drove her family of overachievers, with observations on the Old Hollywood movers and shakers who were her neighbors, friends, and casual acquaintances--reminiscences that are all the more poignant filtered through the wondrous eyes of a child. No mere star-studded autobiography, Weller's work here is framed by an almost palpable sense of personal exorcism and, crucially, a quest for ultimate familial redemption. It's an enlightening personal journey, one whose troubling tales of domestic disconnection may seem all-too-empathetic to many, yet one that ultimately finds a place of warm, if bittersweet, understanding. <i>--Jerry McCulley</i>&#x201c;Dancing at Ciro&#x2019;s is wonderful: honest, compelling, powerful, often funny and very moving. It reanimates a special American time and place by connecting them to a wholly new story---that of Sheila Weller&#x2019;s family---that is also classically American.&#x201d; ---Richard Rhodes, author of the Pulitzer Prize--winning<i> The Making of the Atomic Bomb and A Hole in the World: An American Boyhood</i><br><br>&#x201c;Sheila Weller has written a splendid memoir of upward mobility, Hollywood-style. Dancing at Ciro&#x2019;s is as compelling as a fine novel.&#x201d;---Susan Isaacs, author of <i>Compromising Positions </i>and <i>Long Time No See</i><br><br>&#x201c;This is the book Sheila Weller was born to write. Her memoir of growing up in the glittering crazy darkness of Hollywood circa the forties and fifties is terrific. There is much gossip and movie stars galore since her uncle owned Ciro&#x2019;s---the most popular and glamorous nightclub of the time---but there is also the real life story of her parents&#x2019; marriage and what happened to it, which is both shocking and fascinating. Throughout Weller faces down her demons---and her dreams--- and makes them come vividly alive.&#x201d; ---Patricia Bosworth, author of <i>Everything Your Little Heart Desires: An American Family Story and Montgomery Clift: A Biography</i><br></p><h2>Taste of Home Christmas: 465 Recipes For a Merry Holiday</h2><p><i>Taste of Home Christmas</i> is a holiday cookbook filled with appetizers and beverages, breads, sides, sweets&#x2014;cookies, candies, cakes, pies and more.

It won the Hugo Award for Best Novel, and has since become a landmark in the field. Now, with the long awaited sequel <i>The Children of the Sky </i>about to be published, we are proud to offer the first-ever trade paperback edition of this big-screen SF classic.&nbsp;<i>A Fire Upon The Deep</i> is the winner of the 1993 Hugo Award for Best Novel.</p><p>In this Hugo-winning 1991 SF novel, Vernor Vinge gives us a wild new cosmology, a galaxy-spanning "Net of a Million Lies," some finely imagined aliens, and much nail-biting suspense. <p> Faster-than-light travel remains impossible near Earth, deep in the galaxy's Slow Zone--but physical laws relax in the surrounding Beyond. Outside that again is the Transcend, full of unguessable, godlike "Powers." When human meddling wakes an old Power, the Blight, this spreads like a wildfire mind virus that turns whole civilizations into its unthinking tools. And the half-mythical Countermeasure, if it exists, is lost with two human children on primitive Tines World. </p><p> Serious complications follow. One paranoid alien alliance blames humanity for the Blight and launches a genocidal strike. Pham Nuwen, the man who knows about Countermeasure, escapes this ruin in the spacecraft <i>Out of Band</i>--heading for more violence and treachery, with 500 warships soon in hot pursuit. On his destination world, the fascinating Tines are intelligent only in combination: named "individuals" are small packs of the doglike aliens. Primitive doesn't mean stupid, and opposed Tine leaders wheedle the young castaways for information about guns and radios. Low-tech war looms, with elaborately nested betrayals and schemes to seize <i>Out of Band</i> if it ever arrives. The tension becomes extreme... while half the Beyond debates the issues on galactic Usenet. </p><p> Vinge's climax is suitably mindboggling. This epic combines the flash and dazzle of old-style space opera with modern, polished thoughtfulness. Pham Nuwen also appears in the nifty prequel set 30,000 years earlier, <i>A Deepness in the Sky</i>. Both recommended. <i>--David Langford, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Praise for <i>A Fire Upon the Deep</i>:<p> "Fleeing a menace of galactic proportions, a spaceship crashes on an unfamiliar world, leaving the survivors--a pair of children--to the not-so-tender mercies of a medieval, lupine race. Responding to the crippled ship's distress signal, a rescue mission races against time to retrieve the children and recover the weapon they need to prevent the universe form being forever changed. Against a background depicting a space-time continuum stratified into 'zones of thought,' the author has created a rarity--a unique blend of hard science, high drama, and superb storytelling." --<i>Library Journal</i></p><p> "A tale that burns with the brazen energy of the best space operas of the golden age. Vinge has created a galaxy for the readers of the 90s to believe in...immense, ancient, athrum with data webs, dotted with wonders." --John Clute, <i>Interzone</i></p><p> "Vernor Vinge's best novel yet." --Greg Bear, author of <i>Moving Mars</i></p><p> "Vast, riveting, far-future saga...The overall concept astonishes; the aliens are developed with memorable skill and insight, the plot twists and turns with unputdownable tension. A masterpiece of universe-building." --<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p> "The first grand SF I've read in ages...Vinge is one of the best visionary writers of SF today." --David Brin, author of <i>Earth</i></p><p> "Fiercely original...Compelling ideas in the book include the problems and advantages of group mind, galactic communications turbidity, and the prospect of civilizations aspiring to godhood." --Steward Brand, founder of the <i>Whole Earth Catalog</i></p><p> <i>A New York Times Notable Book of the Year</i></p></p><h2>Not for the Faint of Heart: Lessons in Courage, Power, and Persistence</h2><p><b>Distinguished diplomat Ambassador Wendy Sherman brings readers inside the negotiating room to show how to put diplomatic values like courage, power, and persistence to work in their own lives.</b><br> Few people have sat across from the Iranians <i>and </i>the North Koreans at the negotiating table.

Throughout her life-from growing up in civil-rights-era Baltimore, to stints as a social worker, campaign manager, and business owner, to advising multiple presidents-she has relied on values that have shaped her approach to work and leadership: authenticity, effective use of power and persistence, acceptance of change, and commitment to the team. <br><br><i>Not for the Faint of Heart </i>takes readers inside the world of international diplomacy and into the mind of one of our most effective negotiators-often the only woman in the room. She shows why good work in her field is so hard to do, and how we can learn to apply core skills of diplomacy to the challenges in our own lives. <br><br></p><p><b>Wendy R. Sherman</b> is Senior Counselor at Albright Stonebridge Group and former Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs. In January 2019, Ambassador Sherman will join Harvard Kennedy School as a professor of the practice in public leadership and director of the School's Center for Public Leadership. She serves on the boards of the International Crisis Group and the Atlantic Council, and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Aspen Strategy Group. Ambassador Sherman led the U.S. negotiating team that reached agreement on a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action between the P5+1, the European Union, and Iran for which, among other diplomatic accomplishments, she was awarded the National Security Medal by President Barack Obama. Prior to her service at the Department of State, she was Vice Chair and founding partner of the Albright Stonebridge Group, Counselor of the Department of State under Secretary Madeleine Albright and Special Advisor to President Clinton and Policy Coordinator on North Korea, and Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs under Secretary Warren Christopher. Early in her career, she managed Senator Barbara Mikulski's successful campaign for the U.S Senate and served as Director of EMILY'S list.

At the age of twenty-nine, Genevieve Jones, an amateur naturalist/artist and daughter of a country doctor, visited the 1876 Centennial World's Fair in Philadelphia, where she saw Audubon's paintings in Birds of America on display. His artwork inspired her to undertake the production of a book illustrating the birds nests and eggs that Audubon neglected to include in his work. Her parents were reluctant to support the undertaking of such an ambitious and expensive project until Genevieve became despondent over a broken engagement. Concerned over her fragile mental state, they encouraged her to begin the book as a distraction. Her brother collected the nests and eggs, her father paid for the publishing costs, and Genevieve and her girlhood friend learned lithography and began illustrating the specimens. The book was sold by subscription in twenty-three parts. When part one of Genevieve's work was issued, leading ornithologists praised the illustrations, and Rutherford B. Hayes and Theodore Roosevelt added their names to the subscription list. One reviewer wrote: It is one of the most beautiful and desirable works that has ever appeared in the United States upon any branch of natural history and ranks with Audubon's celebrated work on birds. Then, suddenly, Genevieve died of typhoid fever after personally completing only five of the illustrations. Her family took up the completion of the work in her memory. They labored for seven years until the book was completed in 1886; collecting nests and eggs, drawing lithographs on stone, and hand coloring fifty copies of each illustration, and writing the field notes for each species of bird. Both the brother who collected the nests and eggs and wrote the field notes, and the mother who completed the drawings on stone and hand coloring, were stricken with typhoid fever two years after Genevieve's death and nearly died. In spite of serious damage to their health, they never gave up and labored until the book was finished. The father covered the publishing costs, which were higher than had been anticipated and were not covered by the subscription price, and ultimately lost his entire retirement savings completing the task in his daughter's memory. The mother lost her eyesight at the end of her life from the effects of typhoid fever and long hours of straining to draw and color the nests and eggs. But neither parent ever complained and considered their work on the book the most important accomplishment of their lives. When the mother's copy of the volume was exhibited on the Chicago World's Fair in 1893, it was awarded a bronze medal. Only 90 copies of the book were produced and fewer than 20 have been located today in libraries or in private collections. <em>America's Other Audubon</em> includes a foreword by the Curator of Natural-History Rare Books at the Smithsonian, Leslie Overstreet, a prologue and introduction by researcher and writer Joy M. Kiser (with archival photographs of the family and original advertisements and ephemera from the publication and sale of the book), the 68 original color plates of nests and eggs, plus selected field notes, a key to the eggs, and a key to the birds scientific and current common names (which have changed since the book first published in the nineteenth century). Joy Kiser has been friends with the Jones ancestors for fourteen years and has access to family photographs and documents that the general public has never seen. The Joneses story has never been fully told and no other author is better prepared to tell it.</p><p>Fewer than twenty copies of the original book have been located in U.S. libraries, in private hands, or in sales records today, but the search continues and this book may encourage unknown owners to step forward and contact us."The lithographs in Joy M.

Inspired by Audubon's Birds of America, Jones, the daughter of a country doctor, sought to create a book, "Illustrations of the Nests and Eggs of Birds of Ohio," to complement his work. Jones died during the project -- at 32 from typhoid fever -- but her family finished it. Just 90 copies were made, but now a classic work of science and art, and a fascinating 19th-century life, have been returned to us." --- New York Times<br><br>"If Audubon -- who had plenty of help, but who lives in the mind as a solitary inventor -- is the Robinson Crusoe of nature art, then the Joneses are the Swiss Family Robinson. America's Other Audubon is a vital work of scholarly reclamation that will, I hope, introduce a wide world to the remarkable Genevieve Jones and the familial collaboration her life and death inspired. -- Jonathan Rosen, author of The Life of the Skies: Birding at the End of Nature<br><br>"I have been enjoying simply browsing and admiring this wonderful book, for both the skill of the human artist and the intricacy of the birds' constructions. The most remarkable thing is that this work has been neglected for so long, and I'm very pleased to see it now getting the recognition it deserves." -- David Allen Sibley, author of The Sibley Guide to Birds<br><br>"Exquisite." -- Cleveland Plain Dealer<br><br>"America's Other Audubon, an appropriately lavish large-format volume full of Gennie, Virginia, and Eliza's gorgeous illustrations, captures this extraordinary story of curiosity, creativity, and entrepreneurship with the kind of rigor and passion on par with the Joneses' own." -- BrainPickings<br><br>"America's Other Audubon is an uncommon delight.

Her historical novels have charmed and delighted millions of readers for decades, though she rarely reached out to the public to discuss her works or private life. It is known that she was born in Wimbledon in August 1902, and her first novel, The Black Moth, was published in 1921.</p> <p>Heyer published 56 books over the next 53 years, until her death from lung cancer in 1974. Heyer's large volume of works included Regency romances, mysteries and historical fiction. Known also as the Queen of Regency romance, Heyer was legendary for her research, historical accuracy and her extraordinary plots and characterizations. Her last book, My Lord John, was published posthumously in 1975. She was married to George Ronald Rougier, a mining engineer, and they had one son together, Richard.</p><p><strong>Excerpt from Chapter One</strong></p> <p>Miss Allison thought that Silas Kane's sixtieth birthday party was going off rather better than anyone had imagined it would. Such family gatherings &#x2014; for the Mansells, through long business partnership with Silas, might almost be ranked as relatives &#x2014; were, in Miss Allison's sage opinion, functions to be attended in a spirit of considerable trepidation. Nor had this one promised well at its inception. To begin with, Silas was at polite variance with old Joseph Mansell. Their disagreement was purely on a matter of business, but although Joseph Mansell, a husband and a father, had existence outside the offices of Kane and Mansell, Silas and his business were one and indivisible. He was not, at the best of times, a man who contributed largely to the gaiety of an evening party. He was invariably civil, in an old-world style that seemed to suit his neat little imperial and the large stock-ties he wore, and he would listen as patiently to a discussion on Surr�alism as to the description of the bird life on the Farne Islands which was being imparted to him at the moment by Agatha Mansell. Both subjects bored him, but he inclined his head with an assumption of interest, smiled kindly and coldly, and said Indeed! or Is that so? at the proper moments.</p> <p>Miss Allison, glancing from his thin, pale face, with its austere mouth and its calm, aloof eyes, to Mrs Mansell's countenance, wondered whether a realisation of her host's complete indifference to her conversation would shake Agatha Mansell's magnificent assurance. Probably it would not. Mrs Mansell had been to college in the days when such a distinction earned for a woman the title of Blue-Stocking and the right to think herself superior to her less fortunate sisters. She had preserved through thirty years this pleasant feeling of superiority and an alarmingly cultured voice which could make itself heard without the least vulgar effort above any number of less commanding accents.</p> <p>'We were disappointed at seeing no gunnets,' announced Mrs Mansell. 'Of course, when we were on Ionah last year we saw hundreds of gunnets.'</p> <p>'Ah, is that so indeed?' said Silas Kane.<br> 'I saw a film about a lot of gannets once,' suddenly remarked young Mr Harte. He added disparagingly: 'It wasn't too bad.'</p> <p>Neither Silas nor Mrs Mansell paid any heed to this contribution to the conversation, and young Mr Harte, who was rising fifteen, returned unabashed to the rending of a drum-stick.</p> <p>Young Mr Harte was not really a member of the family, but his mother, by reason of her first marriage with Silas's nephew James, ranked in the Kanes' estimation as a Kane. James had been killed in the Great War, and although the Kanes bore no ill-will towards Sir Adrian Harte, they could never understand why Norma, who was left in comfortable circumstances, had taken it into her head to marry him. </p> <p>Neither Norma nor Sir Adrian was present at this gathering. Norma, who had developed in her thirties a passion for penetrating into the more inaccessible parts of the world, was believed to be amongst pygmies and gorillas in the Belgian Congo, and Sir Adrian, though invited to the party, had excused himself with a vague and graceful plea of a previous engagement. He had sent in his stead, however, his son Timothy, in charge of Jim Kane, his stepson, who was even now trying to catch Miss Allison's eye over the bank of flowers in the middle of the table.</p> <p>Timothy had come to stay. Jim had brought him down in his cream-coloured sports car with a charming note from Sir Adrian. Sir Adrian had providentially remembered that Silas, upon the occasion of Timothy's last visit, had said that he must come again whenever he liked and for as long as he liked, and Sir Adrian, confronted by the task of amusing his son during the eight weeks of his summer holidays, decided that the day of Timothy's liking to visit Cliff House again had dawned. Miss Allison, sedately avoiding Jim Kane's eye, wondered what young Mr Harte would find to do in a household containing herself in attendance upon an old lady of over eighty years, and Silas Kane. He enlightened her. 'Are there any decent films on in Portlaw this month, Miss Allison?' he inquired. 'I don't mean muck about love and that sort of thing, but really good films, with G men and gangsters and things.'</p> <p>Miss Allison confessed ignorance, but said that she would obtain a list of the entertainments offered.</p> <p>'Oh, thanks, awf'ly; but I can easily buzz into Portlaw on my bike,' said Mr Harte. 'I sent it by train, and I dare say it'll be at the station now, though actually when you send things by train they don't arrive until years after you do.' He refreshed himself with a draught of ginger beer, and added with a darkling look across the table: 'As a matter of fact, it was complete drivel sending it by train at all; but some people seem to think nothing matters but their own rotten paint-work.'</p> <p>Jim Kane, at whom this embittered remark was levelled, grinned amiably, and recommended his half-brother to put a sock in it.</p> <p>Miss Allison glanced down the long table to where her employer was seated. Old Mrs Kane, who was over eighty, had been carried downstairs to grace her son's birthday party, not against her wishes (for she would have thought it impossible that any function should be held at Cliff House without her), but firmly denying any expectation of enjoyment. 'I shall have Joseph Mansell on my right and Clement on my left,' she decreed.</p> <p>Miss Allison, who filled the comprehensive role of companion-secretary to Emily Kane, ventured to suggest that more congenial dinner partners might be found than the two selected by her employer. </p> <p>'It is Joe Mansell's right to take the seat of honour,' responded Mrs Kane bleakly. 'And Clement is senior to Jim.'</p> <p>So there was Emily Kane, sitting very upright in her chair at the end of the table, with Joe Mansell, a heavy man with gross features and a hearty laugh, seated on one side of her, and on the other, her great-nephew Clement, the very antithesis of Joe Mansell, but equally displeasing to her.</p></p><h2>Granfa&#39; Grig Had a Pig and Other Rhymes Without Reason</h2><p>A selection of Mother Goose rhymes including &#34;Old King Cole,&#34; &#34;Jack Be Nimble,&#34; and many other well- and lesser-known verses.</p><p></p><h2>Pok�mon Omega Ruby &amp; Pok�mon Alpha Sapphire: The Official National Pok�dex</h2><p>Get the full details on the more than 700 Pok�mon that will help you play the Pok�mon Omega Ruby and Pok�mon Alpha Sapphire video games like a pro!

Keates writes with sympathy and penetration about this extraordinary genius whose career abounded in reversals that would have crushed anyone with less resilience and willpower, but whose influence was to be deeply felt by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven.<br><br>Interwoven with the account of Handel&#x2019;s life are commentaries on all his major works as well as many less familiar pieces by this most inventive, expressive and captivating of composers.</p><p>Jonathan Keates is a prizewinning biographer and novelist, well known as a reviewer and as a writer on Italian culture and history.Following closely on the heels of Christopher Hogwood's impressive biography ( LJ 4/15/85), this latest tercentennial tribute to Handel is less glossy, more subjective, and just as enjoyable as its predecessor. Keates is not a musicologist or performerhe is a Shakespeare scholar and fiction writer, but has an amateur's enthusiasm for his subject and an engaging writing style. Moreover, he is able to avail himself of recent Handel research without deadening the prose. While the writing is essentially nontechnical, there are many astute observations on Handel's musical connections with his contemporaries. Scholars will prefer the excellent bibliography and detailed chronology in Hogwood's book; its clarity and objectivity make it a requisite first choice for libraries. For larger collections, however, Keates's quirky and colorful account will be a fine addition.

Our ideas of correct or proper English have a history, and today's debates over the state of the language-whether about Ebonics in schools, the unique use of language in a South Park episode, or split infinitives in the <i>Times</i>-make sense only in historical context. As historian Jack Lynch has discovered, every rule has a human history, and the characters who populate his narrative are as interesting for their obsessions as for their erudition. Charting the evolution of English with wit and intelligence, he provides a rich historical perspective that makes us appreciate a new the hard-won standards we now enjoy.</p></p><p><b>Jack Lynch</b> is a professor of English at Rutgers University and a Johnson scholar, having studied the great lexicographer for nearly a decade. In addition to his books on Johnson and on Elizabethan England, he has written journal articles and scholarly reviews, and hosts a Web site devoted to these topics at http://andromeda. rutgers.edu/~jlynch/18th/. He is the author of Becoming Shakespeare and Samuel Johnson's Insults and the editor of Samuel Johnson's Dictionary. He lives in Lawrenceville, NJ.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by by Carolyn See This delightful look at efforts through the centuries to define and control the English language turns out to be a history of human exasperation, frustration and free-floating angst. People tend to go nuts around the English language. Of course, most of us are nuts anyway, but the language is always there, in the ether, or staring at us from a page, and if we're feeling particularly cranky, it never fails to provide a ready excuse for us to fly off the handle. I get afflicted with that crankiness when a television anchor describes a Chihuahua rescued from drowning as "very unique," or a woman I scarcely know pronounces "forte" as "fortay," or when a close relative of mine, when she descended (with enthusiasm!) into the life of the underworld, began to say, "He don't." I wanted to tell her, "Commit any crime you like. Just don't murder the language while you're at it!" Many of us are irritable most of the time (unless we're in love or just bought a motorcycle), and our language continually offers up imperfections and anomalies for us to be irritable about. In the words of a waiter who once brought me a menu in a way-too-authentic Chinese restaurant, there's always "something in there you're not going to like!" Jack Lynch, who also has written on Shakespeare and edited Samuel Johnson's Dictionary, gives us not a history of the English language but a history of those who have tried to make sense of it. He divides them into "prescriptive" and "descriptive" linguists: The former try with all their might to purge the language of undesirable words and constructions; the latter, acting on the theory that the language is untamable, simply try to describe its current use. (That, too, seems futile often enough -- like describing a tidal wave as it booms by.) After an amusing and very interesting introduction, Lynch begins with John Dryden. (Don't worry: Lynch dutifully goes back later to 1066, the Norman Conquest and the "marriage" of Anglo-Saxon and French.) But Dryden -- famous, esteemed by all (or most, anyway) -- was one of the first English writers to revisit his work and revise it in accordance with certain rules of Latin grammar. One of the reasons this book is so much fun is that you get to see how relatively new and recent and lively modern English is. At the end of the 17th century, Latin grammarians were just becoming influential in English society. The English language itself didn't have a formal grammar, but Latin did, and it seemed sensible to think that the rules of this revered dead language might easily be applied to bumptious, wildly growing, very-much-alive English. Dryden set about lopping prepositions off the ends of his sentences (they're not called prepositions for nothing!) and spent time sticking his split infinitives back together. The idea of "good" English as opposed to "bad" was coming into play. This, Lynch says, had to do with the rise of the middle class -- a set of interlopers who had had the luck and nerve to earn some money, and thus aspired to fake their way into the outer realms of the ruling elite. One of the necessary tools for this was knowledge of how the language was spoken and written by those who lived at the top. For those who have taken their share of English classes, all this material might seem familiar, but that doesn't diminish the pleasure of seeing Jonathan Swift, in the 18th century, being driven ape-crazy by the use of contractions like "wouldn't" and trendy abbreviations like "mob" for the Latin "mobile vulgus" (fickle crowd). "Mob" had the effect of "very unique" on Swift, and years after he first wrote a screed on the topic, he still flung himself into a rage when a woman he knew used the word in conversation: "Why do you say that?" he railed, "never let me hear you say that word again." When the woman asked what she should say instead, he answered, "The rabble, to be sure." People are crazy, that's the long and the short of it, and even with one of the biggest, most imaginative and attractive languages on the planet, they will discover ways to fiddle with it. After Samuel Johnson's Dictionary, which, although certainly opinionated, was largely descriptive, there arose those pesky, prescriptive Latin grammarians who did everything they could to hammer English into a Latin mold. Then, when the American Revolution came along, a patriot named Noah Webster compiled a uniquely American dictionary, taking the opportunity to thumb his nose at Johnson in the process. Then came the long decades in which a group of dedicated scholars labored to put together the Oxford English Dictionary. The first installment appeared in 1884, the last in 1928. A lot of very learned people got sick and died during the execution of this valiant project, and as soon as it was finished -- sooner, even -- it required extensive revision. And more revision. And then came the hordes of people with nothing better to do with their lives than to carp about the differences between "who" and "whom" and a mountain of split infinitives, because the language, besides providing a convenient subject to be enraged at, also offered a refuge for otherwise unemployable cranks. The unseemly squabbling never lets up, actually. The author revisits the tempest in a teapot that recently surrounded the teaching of ebonics in the Oakland, Calif., school system. (The critics went out of their way to be both racist and smug.) And before that, there was the scorn heaped upon the editor of Webster's Third New International Dictionary, a man who thought it helpful to include words that people were using by the dawn of the '60s, like "hipster" and "drip-dry." Scholars went berserk, of course. And that's what this book is about: humans going berserk. In the end, this language mania is probably preferable to sitting on the couch watching television, enduring an angst-attack over how Kate Hudson lets her jaw go slack when she smiles. That's truly crazy, which is why we're fortunate to have a language over which to pitch our fits. bookworld@washpost.com <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

Although this inventive and engaging volume bears no actual connection to the mighty Master Potter, many of the projects were clearly inspired by his adventures and attributes. Seems just about everyone is jumping on the wizard-craze bandwagon these days, but this spirited incarnation is done with skill.<p> Wishing to pass along his 600 year's worth of arcane lore, the ancient wizard behind this creative collection shares his secrets for wizard regalia (bejeweled turban, hourglass pendant, magic cloak, wands, staffs, and the obligatory robe), the decorative arts (magic carpet, crystal ball, celestial sheets), horticulture (fairy circle, carnivorous-plant terrarium), animal husbandry (dragon scales, eye of newt, apothecary carry-all), book arts (secret journal, invisible inks, quill pen), astronomy (constellation caster), alchemy (magic potions galore), and amusement (party ideas, decorations, spooky edibles), and much more. Bewitching painted illustrations add sprightly fun and help to further clarify relatively good directions. Even kids who want nothing to do with sorcery in the craft room will enjoy reading the magical myths, international legends, and witchy stories. <i>--Amy Handy</i></p>Both: Asheville, NC<br></p><h2>Theodore Roosevelt</h2><p>Henry F.

When Aunt Eleanor, now a WASP pilot, stops for a visit while ferrying a warplane from one airbase to another, a security check uncovers anti-American propaganda stashed aboard her plane. The FBI interrogates Eleanor but quickly zeroes in on another suspect--Anna&#39;s 17-year-old brother Max, who works at the local airfield. Though Anna knows her brother is loyal to America, she fears he&#39;ll be sent away to an interment camp as an enemy alien, as other German-American friends have been. Molly and Anna decide that the only way to clear Max is to find the person who is smuggling propaganda. With lots of daring and a little luck, the girls manage to finger the real culprit...but they discover that that may not be enough to save Max. In a poignant ending, Molly realizes that wartime, even on the home front, changes friends and family forever.</p><p></p><h2>While Standing on One Foot: Puzzle Stories and Wisdom Tales from the Jewish Tradition</h2><p><br>Here are eighteen stories from the Jewish tradition that challenge you to answer a question or solve a puzzle. When you've done your best, the authors give you answers that have come down through time. Can you outthink the sages, or will they help you out of a tight spot?<br><br></p><p><br>Nina Jaffe is the author of <i>The Way Meat Loves Salt</i> and the biography of Harold Courlander, entitled <i>A Voice for the People</i>.<br><br>Steve Zeitlin is the director of City Lore in New York City. The two authors have also collaborated on a sequel to <i>While Standing on One Foot</i>, called <i>The Cow of No Color</i>.<br><br>John Segal's illustrations have appeared in picture books and numerous magazines.<br><br>Gr. 4-7. Quite different from Jaffe's recent collection of Jewish holiday stories <i>The Uninvited Guest</i> , this anthology of 17 folktales by and large eschews the magical and fabulous. Most of these tales, which are presented as intellectual puzzles, are solidly grounded in the ways of human nature and human ingenuity. The writing is full of life and often very funny. Each story is written in two parts (the first sets the scene; the second reveals how the conflict was resolved), separated by a question designed to challenge children's creative thinking skills and match their wisdom with the wisdom of the sages: "Can you guess how this clever traveler escaped his fate?" "If you were the beautiful princess, who would you choose?" The gimmick will pique children's interest, though it's unlikely kids will guess the actual solutions. The collection is wonderfully diverse, ranging from a classic tale about the wise fools of Chelm to one set in 1930s Germany. There's even an animal parable. Headnotes supply appropriate historical context and fill in cultural information gaps, while careful notes at the end of the book detail story sources. With black-and-white illustrations that have the appealing simplicity of children's own artwork, this is a stellar collection that will be read, pondered over, and enjoyed again and again. A glossary and bibliography are included. <i>Stephanie Zvirin</i></p><h2>Cowboy: The Enduring Myth of the Wild West</h2><p>Combining hundreds of paintings, photographs, and film stills, this tribute to the American cowboy captures the evolution of an American symbol and the reality of the Western frontier</p><p></p><h2>SHOCK ROCK</h2><p>A collection of horror stories that delve deeply into the dark side of rock-and-roll, with contributions by Stephen King, David J. Schow, Thomas Tessier, F. Paul Wilson, and Rex Miller</p><p>Any literary anthology is going to exhibit a range of quality, both in material and-in terms of audiobooks-reader ability. In the case of SHOCK ROCK, a collection of rock'n' roll-inspired horror stories, that range varies far too greatly. Of the three cassettes, one is a compilation of music; the other two are stories. Whatever else it has to offer, SHOCK ROCK does prove one thing: Talent doesn't necessarily translate from one art form to another. While Joan Jett's raspy voice is alluring as she reads about a rock group returning from the dead, only Mumy manages to make this rise above an audiobook gimmick.

His illustrations have been published in more than thirty countries. He lives in London, England.</p>Kindergarten-Grade 3&#x2014;Tiddler is a tiny fish with a propensity for tall tales. Habitually late for school, he offers a different excuse each day. He's been riding a seahorse, got trapped in a treasure chest, was captured by a squid, etc. The other students discount his stories, but Little Johnny Dory loves them and passes them on to his grandmother, who tells a crab, who tells a plaice, and so on. When Tiddler's daydreaming lands him far from home, it is the retracing of the trail of his own stories that leads him back again. The rhyme scheme here isn't precise, but it is reader-friendly, and invites participation: "'Sorry I'm late, Miss. I set off really early,/but on the way to school I was captured by a squid./I wriggled and I struggled till a turtle came and rescued me.'/'Oh no he didn't.' 'OH YES HE DID.'" The title here is a bit misleading as Tiddler doesn't tell his tales to mislead anyone deliberately, as in the original fable. Instead, he resembles Dr. Seuss's Marco from <i>And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street</i> (Random, 1989), whose imagination is similarly bursting at the seams. The colorful, detailed illustrations feature an endearing cast of undersea denizens with the text woven through on clean white space.

It is done with the same expository skill and practical application as Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones sermons. Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones (1899-1981) was born in Wales. He was a dairyman&#39;s assistant, a political enthusiast, debater, and chief clinical assistant to Sir Thomas Harder, the King of England&#39;s Physician. But at the age of 27 he gave up a most promising medical career to become a preacher... When a spiritual history of the 20th century comes to be written it will be bound to include mention not only the far-reaching influence of Dr. Lloyd-Jones&#39; ministry at Westminster Chapel in London, England from 1938-68, but of the remarkable fact that his published volumes of expository sermons have had an unprecedented circulation for such material, selling in millions of copies.</p><p></p><h2>The Eloise Wilkin Treasury: Favorite Nursery Rhymes, Prayers, Poems, and Stories</h2><p>An illustrated collection of nursery rhymes, poems, prayers, and stories.</p><p>Eloise Wilkin (1904&#x2013;1987) illustrated dozens of classic Golden Books in her long career. Famous for her instantly recognizable style, she provided the art for such books as<i> Baby Dear, We Help Momm</i>y, and the original Little Golden Book versions of <i>Prayers for Children</i> and <i>My Little Golden Book About God</i>.<br><i>From the Board edition.</i>Since 1927, Wilkin's books have been enormously popular with parents and children, primarily because of her inimitable pictures. She is hard to beat at evoking a response to the young boys and girls, flowers and wild animals, that she captures in color and essence. Here are choices from Wilkin's earlier books: nursery rhymes, prayers, poems and stories. One section features babies from different ethnic backgrounds, alike in their "specialness." They are cuddly and little; they enjoy splashing in a tub, shaking a rattle, "Peek-a-Boo," brothers and sisters to play with. The short stories include a dandy about Georgie. His wish for a grandfather is granted when he finds a good friend who yearns for a grandson. Rounding out the collection are poems by Shelley, Christina Rossetti, Gerard Manley Hopkins, William Blake et al., plus the words and music to "Kumbaya," an African hymn. <br>Copyright 1985 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Birthday of the World: And Other Stories</h2><p><p>For more than four decades, Ursula K. Le Guin has enthralled readers with her imagination, clarity, and moral vision. The recipient of numerous literary prizes, including the National Book Award, the Kafka Award, and five Hugo and five Nebula Awards, this renowned writer has, in each story and novel, created a provocative, ever-evolving universe filled with diverse worlds and rich characters reminiscent of our earthly selves. Now, in <em>The Birthday of the World</em>, this gifted artist returns to these worlds in eight brilliant short works, including a never-before-published novella, each of which probes the essence of humanity.</p><p>Here are stories that explore complex social interactions and troublesome issues of gender and sex; that define and defy notions of personal relationships and of society itself; that examine loyalty, survival, and introversion; that bring to light the vicissitudes of slavery and the meaning of transformation, religion, and history. </p><p>The first six tales in this spectacular volume are set in the author's signature world of the Ekumen, "my pseudo-coherent universe with holes in the elbows," as Le Guin describes it -- a world made familiar in her award-winning novel <em>The Left Hand of Darkness</em>. The seventh, title story was hailed by <em>Publishers Weekly</em> as "remarkable . . . a standout." The final offering in the collection, <em>Paradises Lost</em>, is a mesmerizing novella of space exploration and the pursuit of happiness.</p><p>In her foreword, Ursula K. Le Guin writes, "to create difference-to establish strangeness-then to let the fiery arc of human emotion leap and close the gap: this acrobatics of the imagination fascinates and satisfies me as no other." In <em>The Birthday of the World</em>, this gifted literary acrobat exhibits a dazzling array of skills that will fascinate and satisfy us all.</p></p><p><p>Ursula Kroeber Le Guin was born in 1929 in Berkeley, and lives in Portland, Oregon. As of 2014, she has published twenty-one novels, eleven volumes of short stories, four collections of essays, twelve books for children, six volumes of poetry, and four of translation, and has received many honors and awards, including the Hugo, Nebula, National Book Award, and PEN/Malamud. Her most recent publications are <em>Finding My Elegy: New and Selected Poems</em> and <em>The Unreal and the Real: Selected Stories</em>.</p>Deeply concerned with gender, these eight stories, although ostensibly about aliens, are all about ourselves: love, sex, life and alienation are all handled with illuminating grace. Le Guin's overarching theme, the journey, informs her characters as they struggle to come to terms with themselves or their worlds. The journey can be literal, as in "Paradises Lost," set on a generational ship, where the inhabitants, living in a utopia, learn they will land on the planet their ancestors set out to colonize 40 years earlier; and as in "Unchosen Love," where a young man falls in love with someone in another country and must decide if he can build a new life in a new place. Or the journey can be figurative, as in "Coming of Age in Karhide," in which an adolescent in a genderless society enters sexual maturity; and in "Solitude," as outsiders visit and study a planet where the men and women live apart and a young woman seeks to perfect her soul in the only place she knows as home. In "The Birthday of the World," the nature of God is considered as hereditary rulers, literal gods to their subjects, give up their power when new gods aliens come, throwing their culture into chaos. Gender is a constant concern: "The Matter of Seggri" takes place on a planet where women greatly outnumber men, and in "Unchosen Love" and "Mountain Ways," society is based on complex marriage relationships comprising four people. Le Guin handles these difficult topics through her richly drawn characters and her believable worlds. Evocative, richly textured and lyrically written, this collection is a must-read for Le Guin's fans. (Mar. 13)National Book Award, Le Guin published two major books last year, Tales from Earthsea and The Other Wind.<p></p><p>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Dementia Beyond Disease: Enhancing Well-Being</h2><p>This book builds upon the foundation of Power&#39;s award-winning book, Dementia Beyond Drugs, to reframe the care and support of people living with dementia.

Hollander suggests how to incorporate succession planning for a vacation home into an estate plan and gives practical advice on such things as which entity is best for succession planning, how to develop a cottage schedule, what to do about an owner who fails to pay his or her assessment, whether to establish an 'endowment,' and how to allocate control between and within generations of owners. <p>Although Hollander uses the term 'cottage,' the principles of his book apply to any property that a family wants to retain, whether it is an Adirondack camp, an Upper Midwest cabin, a Western ranch, or beach home property on an ocean, lake, or river. Written for the vacation home owner but with information that also will be useful to attorneys and financial planners, the book engages the reader with stories of cottage 'wars' and planning gone awry. Narrative examples and easy-to-follow graphics illustrate the more technical aspects of succession planning for a vacation home. The book makes a complex problem understandable and offers methods to help keep a second home in the family for generations. </p><p>The second edition was published to acknowledge the addition of David S. Fry, Esq. as the editor and successor to the author's cottage law practice. Fry brings his years of experience as an attorney and fourth generation cottage owner to the book.</p></p><p>The first attorney authored book written for the vacation home owner describes the problems inherent to shared cottage ownership and the concerns of parents who wish to pass it on.<b>Rose Hollander</b> has spent more than 19 years working and living in the heart of Michigan cottage country.

Starr, Jr.</h2><p>This riveting narrative details the mysterious disappearance of Peter Starr, a San Francisco attorney from a prominent family, who set off to climb alone in the rugged Minaret region of the Sierra Nevada in 1933. Rigorous and thorough searches by some of the best climbers in the history of the range failed to locate him, despite a number of promising clues. When all hope seemed gone and the last search party had left the Minarets, mountaineering legend Norman Clyde refused to give up. Climbing alone, he persevered in the face of failure, resolved that he would learn the fate of the lost man.

Aimlessly, unable to decide whether it wanted to fall up or down, just letting itself be driven by the hellish, ice-cold wind that was sweeping in from the great darkness covering the Oslo fjord. Together they swirled, wind and snow, round and round in the darkness between the warehouses on the quayside that were all shut for the night. Until the wind got fed up and dumped its dance partner beside the wall. And there the dry, windswept snow was settling around the shoes of the man I had just shot in the chest and neck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Blood was dripping down onto the snow from the bottom of his shirt. I don&#x2019;t actually know a lot about snow&#x2014;or much else, for that matter&#x2014;but I&#x2019;ve read that snow crystals formed when it&#x2019;s really cold are completely different from wet snow, heavy flakes, or the crunchy stuff. That it&#x2019;s the shape of the crystals and the dryness of the snow that make the haemoglobin in the blood retain that deep red colour. Either way, the snow under him made me think of a king&#x2019;s robe, all purple and lined with ermine, like the drawings in the book of Norwegian folk tales my mother used to read to me. She liked fairy tales and kings. That&#x2019;s probably why she named me after a king.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The <i>Evening Post</i> had said that if the cold carried on like this until New Year, 1977 would be the coldest year since the war, and that we&#x2019;d remember it as the start of the new ice age scientists had been predicting for a while. But what did I know? All I knew was that the man standing in front of me would soon be dead. There was no mistaking the way his body was shaking. He was one of the Fisherman&#x2019;s men. It was nothing personal. I told him as much before he collapsed, leaving a smear of blood down the wall. If I ever get shot, I&#x2019;d rather it was personal. I didn&#x2019;t say it to stop his ghost coming after me&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t believe in ghosts. I just couldn&#x2019;t think of anything else to say. Obviously I could have just kept my mouth shut. That&#x2019;s what I usually do, after all. So there must have been something that made me so talkative all of a sudden. Maybe it was because there were only a few days to go before Christmas. I&#x2019;ve heard that people are supposed to feel closer to each other around Christmas. But what do I know?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I thought the blood would freeze on top of the snow and end up just lying there. But instead the snow sucked the blood up as it fell, drawing it in under the surface, hiding it, as if it had some sort of use for it. As I walked home I imagined a snowman rising up from the snowdrift, one with clearly visible veins of blood under its deathly pale skin of ice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On the way back to my flat I called Daniel Hoffmann from a phone box to tell him the job was done.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hoffmann said that was good. As usual, he didn&#x2019;t ask any questions. Either he&#x2019;d learned to trust me in the course of the four years I&#x2019;d been working as a fixer for him, or else he didn&#x2019;t actually want to know. The job was done, so why would a man like him trouble himself with that sort of thing when what he was paying for was to have fewer problems? Hoffmann asked me to go down to the office the next day&#x2014;he said he had a new job for me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;A new job?&#x201d; I asked, feeling my heart skip a beat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Hoffmann said. &#x201c;As in a new commission.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, okay.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I hung up, relieved. I don&#x2019;t really do much more than commissions. I can&#x2019;t actually be used for much more than that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here are four things I can&#x2019;t be used for. Driving a getaway car. I can drive fast, that&#x2019;s fine. But I can&#x2019;t drive inconspicuously, and anyone driving a getaway car has to be able to do both. They have to be able to drive so they look just like any other car on the road. I landed myself and two other men in prison because I can&#x2019;t drive inconspicuously enough. I drove like a demon, switching between forest tracks and main roads, and I&#x2019;d long since lost our pursuers, and was just a few kilometres from the Swedish border. I slowed down and drove in a steady, law-abiding way like a grandad on a Sunday outing. And we still got stopped by a police patrol. They said afterwards that they had no idea it was the car used in the robbery, and that I hadn&#x2019;t been driving too fast or breaking any of the rules of the road. They said it was the <i>way</i> I was driving. I&#x2019;ve no idea what they meant, but they said it was suspicious.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I can&#x2019;t be used in robberies. I&#x2019;ve read that more than half of all bank employees who experience a robbery end up with psychological problems afterwards, some of them for the rest of their lives. I don&#x2019;t know why, but the old man who was behind the counter of the post office when we went in was in a big hurry to develop psychological problems. He fell to pieces just because the barrel of my shotgun was pointed in his general direction, apparently. I saw in the paper the next day that he was suffering from psychological problems. Not much of a diagnosis, but either way, if there&#x2019;s one thing you don&#x2019;t want, it&#x2019;s psychological problems. So I went to visit him in hospital. Obviously he didn&#x2019;t recognise me&#x2014;I&#x2019;d been wearing a Santa Claus mask in the post office. (It was the perfect disguise. No one gave a second glance to three lads in Santa Claus outfits carrying sacks as they ran out of a post office in the middle of the Christmas shopping crowds.) I stopped in the doorway to the ward and looked at the old man. He was reading <i>Class Struggle,</i> the Communist newspaper. Not that I&#x2019;ve got anything against Communists as individuals. Okay, maybe I have. But I don&#x2019;t <i>want</i> to have anything against them as individuals, I just think they&#x2019;re wrong. So I felt a bit guilty when I realised that I felt a lot better because the bloke was reading <i>Class Struggle.</i> But obviously there&#x2019;s a big difference between feeling a bit guilty and a lot guilty. And like I said, I felt a <i>lot</i> better. But I stopped doing robberies. After all, there was no guarantee the next one would be a Communist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And I can&#x2019;t work with drugs, that&#x2019;s number three. I just can&#x2019;t do it. It&#x2019;s not that I can&#x2019;t get money out of people who are in debt to my employers. Junkies only have themselves to blame, and in my opinion people should pay for their mistakes, plain and simple. The problem&#x2019;s more that I have a weak, sensitive nature, as my mum once put it. I suppose she saw herself in me. Either way, I have to stay well away from drugs. Like her, I&#x2019;m the sort of person who&#x2019;s just looking for someone to submit to. Religion, a big-brother figure, a boss. Drink and drugs. Besides, I can&#x2019;t do math either, I can hardly count to ten without losing my concentration. Which is kind of stupid if you&#x2019;re going to sell drugs or collect debts&#x2014;that ought to be pretty obvious.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Okay. Last one. Prostitution. Same sort of thing there. I don&#x2019;t have a problem with women earning money whatever way they like, and the idea that a bloke&#x2014;me, for instance&#x2014;should get a third of the money for sorting things out so the women can concentrate on the actual work. A good pimp is worth every krone they pay him, I&#x2019;ve always thought that. The problem is that I fall in love so quickly, and then I stop seeing it in terms of business. And I can&#x2019;t handle shaking, hitting or threatening the women, whether or not I&#x2019;m in love with them. Something to do with my mother, maybe, what do I know? That&#x2019;s probably why I can&#x2019;t stand seeing other people beating up women either. Something just snaps. Take Maria, for instance. Deaf and dumb, with a limp. I don&#x2019;t know what those two things have got to do with each other&#x2014;nothing probably&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s a bit like once you start getting bad cards, they just keep coming. Which is probably why Maria ended up with an idiot junkie boyfriend as well. He had a fancy French name, Myriel, but owed Hoffmann thirteen thousand for drugs. The first time I saw her was when Pine, Hoffmann&#x2019;s head pimp, pointed out a girl in a home-made coat and with her hair up in a bun, looking like she&#x2019;d just left church. She was sitting on the steps in front of Ridderhallen, crying, and Pine told me she was going to have to pay back her boyfriend&#x2019;s drug debt in kind. I thought it best to give her a gentle start, just hand-jobs. But she jumped out of the first car she got into after barely ten seconds. She stood there in floods of tears while Pine yelled at her. Maybe he thought she&#x2019;d hear him if he shouted loud enough. Maybe that was what did it. The yelling. And my mum. Either way, something snapped, and even if I could see what Pine was trying to get into her head by the use of very loud sound waves, I ended up decking him, my own boss. Then I took Maria to a flat I knew was empty, then went to tell Hoffmann that I was no use as a pimp either.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Hoffmann said&#x2014;and I had to agree with him&#x2014;that he couldn&#x2019;t let people get away without paying their debts, because that sort of thing soon spreads to other, more important customers. So, well aware that Pine and Hoffmann were after the girl because she&#x2019;d been stupid enough to take on her boyfriend&#x2019;s debts, I went out looking until I found the Frenchman in a squat up in Fagerborg. He was both wrecked by drugs and broke, so I realised I wasn&#x2019;t going to get a single krone out of him, no matter how much I shook him. I said that if he so much as approached Maria again I&#x2019;d smash his nose into his brain. To be honest, I&#x2019;m not sure there was much left of either of them. So I went back to Hoffmann, said the boyfriend had managed to get hold of some money, handed him thirteen thousand and said I presumed that meant hunting season on the girl was over.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I don&#x2019;t know if Maria had been a user while they were together, if she was the sort who looked for ways to be submissive, but she seemed pretty straight now, at least. She worked in a small supermarket, and I looked in every now and then to make sure things were okay, and that her junkie boyfriend hadn&#x2019;t popped up to ruin things for her again. Obviously I made sure she couldn&#x2019;t see me, just stood outside in the darkness looking into the well-lit shop, watching her sitting at the till, putting things in bags, and pointing at one of the others if anyone spoke to her. Every so often I suppose we all need to feel that we&#x2019;re living up to our parents. I don&#x2019;t know what Dad had that I could live up to&#x2014;this is probably more about Mum. She was better at looking after other people than herself, and I suppose I saw that as a kind of ideal back then. God knows. Either way, I didn&#x2019;t really have much use for the money I was earning from Hoffmann. So what if I dealt a decent card to a girl who&#x2019;d been given such a lousy hand?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway. To sum up, let&#x2019;s put it like this: I&#x2019;m no good at driving slowly, I&#x2019;m way too soft, I fall in love far too easily, I lose my head when I get angry, and I&#x2019;m bad at math. I&#x2019;ve read a bit, but I don&#x2019;t really know much, and certainly nothing anyone would find useful. And stalactites grow faster than I can write.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So what on earth can a man like Daniel Hoffmann use someone like me for?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The answer is&#x2014;as you might have worked out already&#x2014;as a fixer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I don&#x2019;t have to drive, and I mostly kill the sort of men who deserve it, and the numbers -aren&#x2019;t exactly hard to keep track of. Not right now, anyway.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are two calculations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To start with, there&#x2019;s the one that&#x2019;s ticking away the whole time: When exactly do you reach the point where you know so much about your boss that he starts to get worried? And when do you know he&#x2019;s beginning to wonder if he ought to fix the fixer? Like one of those black widows. Not that I know much about arachnology or whatever it&#x2019;s called, but I think the widows let the males, who are much smaller, fuck them. Then, when he&#x2019;s finished and the female has no more use for him, she eats him. In <i>Animal Kingdom 4: Insects and Spiders</i> in the Deichman Library there&#x2019;s a picture of a black widow with the male&#x2019;s chewed-off pedipalp, which is like the spider&#x2019;s cock, still hanging from her genitals. And you can see the blood-red, hourglass-shaped mark on the female&#x2019;s abdomen. Because the hourglass is running, you pathetic, randy little male spider, and you need to keep to your allotted visiting time. Or, to be more accurate, you need to know when visiting time is over. And then you get the fuck out of there, come what may, with a couple of bullets in the side or whatever&#x2014;you just have to get away, to the only thing that can save you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That&#x2019;s how I saw it. Do what you have to, but don&#x2019;t get too close.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And that&#x2019;s why I was seriously fucking worried about the new job Hoffmann had given me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He wanted me to fix his wife.</p></p><h2>Christmas at the Bear&#39;s Paw Ranch</h2><p>Join Eleanor and the Quilt in a Day Staff for festive holiday sewing and crafts!

She presented her unique style, a diverse combination of cutting and sewing applications, creating new techniques altogether. Her concise step by step directions are easy to grasp, allowing the possibility for anyone to be successful at making a quilt. Eleanor Burns gave quiltmakers techniques that compacted months into merely a day, a quilt in a day, spreading her vibrant enthusiasm within everyone. She has motivated thousands of want-to-be quilters with needed confidence and assurance. Altogether, the impact of her influences opened the door to a renewal. Her efforts sowed the seeds that have grown into many techniques that are commonly used today. Since 1978 when she self-published her first book Make a Quilt in a Day: Log Cabin Pattern, she has authored over seventy five additional books. Throughout the world today, there are thousands of inst!ructors teaching her quiltmaking methods. Her first Quilt in a Day TV series began airing on PBS in 1990 and is still broadcast nationwide and abroad and now her shows can be seen on the world wide web on QNN and Quilters TV.</p><h2>Houdini!!!: The Career of Ehrich Weiss</h2><p>Chronicles the life and career of the legendary Harry Houdini</p><p>Silverman&#39;s engaging biography catalogs the life of Harry Houdini, born Ehrich Weiss, who made a career out of his capacity to amaze. Having developed conjuring skills and an ability to wriggle free of handcuffs, ropes and manacles, Houdini elaborated his tricks into theatrical set pieces that made him famous--stunts like escaping from a strait jacket while dangling head down from a skyscraper, or from a wooden packing crate submerged in water. Silverman&#39;s meticulously researched book reveals other sides to the great illusionist too. Houdini collected a library of books on magic, wrote books himself, exposed shyster psychics whose tricks he could easily match, and was a friend to Jack London, Sarah Bernhardt and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.Kenneth Silverman is a professor of English, a graduate advisor in American Civilization, co-director of The Biography Seminar at New York University, and an amateur magician.

A &#34;New York Times&#34; Notable Book of the Year&#34;.</p><p>Joe Lansdale, author of several horror novels, Westerns, and some outrageous thrillers, is something of a cult writer. <i>The Bottoms</i>, which may be the breakout book that moves Lansdale beyond the genre category, is a resonant and moving novel. Though there is a mystery at its core, it is at heart a coming-of-age story, with a more literary bent than Lansdale usually demonstrates. <p> Harry, an elderly man, tells the story of a series of events that occurred in his 11th year, when the mutilated, murdered bodies of Negro prostitutes began turning up in the county where his father was the local constable. Harry and Tom, his younger sister, find the first one. Only their father, Jacob Crane, seems to care about finding justice for the victims, who are dismissed out of hand as unimportant by the local branch of the Ku Klux Klan, which warns Jacob off any further investigations. Harry and Tom think they know who's responsible: the Goat Man, a creature who's said to lurk beneath the swinging bridge that crosses the Sabine River, where the first body was found. In fact, the Goat Man has something to do with the murders, and the secret of who he is and what he really did is the key to the unsolved slayings. But that takes second place to the artfully explicated character of Jacob and Harry's changing relationship with him in the course of the loss of his boyish innocence. This is a masterfully told story and a very good read. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>Where does Mojo storytelling come from? How does a fella learn tospin over-the-top yarns of any sort: horror, suspense, humor, science fiction, Western, what have you? First you got to see the world, like champion Mojo storyteller Joe R. Lansdale, who has lived everywhere from Gladewater, Texas to Mount Enterprise, Texas to Nacogdoches, Texas! &#34;Texas is so wrapped up in myth and legend, it&#39;s hard to know what the state and its people are really about,&#34; says Lansdale. &#34;Real Texans, raised on these myths and legends, sometimes become legends themselves. The bottom line is, Texas and its people are pretty much what most people mean when they use the broader term &#39;America.&#39; No state better represents the independent spirit, the can-do attitude of America, better than Texas.&#34; The second ingredient to good Mojo storytelling is learning how to take a punch. Or a kick. Or a poke in the eye. And then learning how to avoid them. Lansdale is a student of the martial arts for more than thirty years. He&#39;s a two-time inductee into the International Martial Arts Hall of Fame, one such honor bestowed upon him for his founding of Shen Chuan, Martial Science. He holds belts in Daito Ryu Aikijujutsu, Combat Hapkido, American Combat Kempo, and Aikido, amongst others; in fact, his standard day is six hours at the typewriter, three hours at Lansdale&#39;s Self Defense Systems, the martial-arts studio which he owns and at which he teaches. With more than twenty books to his credit-and 200 short stories-Joe R. Lansdale is the champion Mojo storyteller. He&#39;s been called &#34;the Stephen King of Texas&#34; by Texas Monthly; &#34;an immense talent&#34; by Booklist; &#34;a born storyteller&#34; by Robert Bloch; and The New York Times Book Review declares he has &#34;a folklorist&#39;s eye for telling detail and a front-porch raconteur&#39;s sense of pace.&#34; He&#39;s won umpty-ump awards, including five Bram Stoker horror awards, a British Fantasy Award, the American Mystery Award, the Horror Critics Award, the &#34;Shot in the Dark&#34;. International Crime Writer&#39;s award, the Booklist Editor&#39;s Award, the Critic&#39;s Choice Award, and a New York Times Notable Book award. He&#39;s got the most decorated mantle in all of Nacogdoches! Lansdale lives in Nacogdoches, Texas, with his wife, Karen-an occasional writer and editor-and their son and daughter, Keith and Kasey.</p><h2>Harcourt School Publishers Science: Student Edition Grade 3ence 20 2008</h2><p>Harcourt School Publishers Science California: Student Edition Grade 3ence 20 2008</p><p></p><h2>British and Irish Mythology: An Encyclopedia of Myth and Legend</h2><p>Identifies the gods, heroes, saints, and legends of British myths, from Alfred the Great to the Wild Man of the Wood.</p><p></p><h2>The Millionaire and the Mummies: Theodore Davis&#x2019;s Gilded Age in the Valley of the Kings</h2><p><p>Egypt, The Valley of the Kings, 1905: An American robber baron peers through the hole he has cut in an ancient tomb wall and discovers the richest trove of golden treasure ever seen in Egypt. <br>At the start of the twentieth century, Theodore Davis was the most famous archaeologist in the world; his career turned tomb-robbing and treasure-hunting into a science. Using six of Davis's most important discoveries in archaeology-from the female Pharaoh Hatshepsut's sarcophagus to the exquisite s<i>habti</i> statuettes looted from the Egyptian Museum not too long ago-as a lens around which to focus his quintessentially American rags-to-riches tale, Adams chronicles the dizzying rise of a poor country preacher's son who, through corruption and fraud, amassed tremendous wealth in Gilded Age New York and then atoned for his ruthless career by inventing new standards for systematic excavation in the field of archaeology. Davis found a record eighteen tombs in the Valley and, breaking with custom, gave all the spoils of his discoveries to museums. A confederate of Boss Tweed, friend of Teddy Roosevelt, and rival of J. P. Morgan, the colorful "American Lord Carnarvon" shared his Newport mansion with his Rembrandts, his wife, <i>and</i> his mistress. The only reason Davis has been forgotten by history to a large extent is probably the fact that he stopped just short of King Tutankhamen's tomb, the discovery of which propelled Howard Carter (Davis's erstwhile employee) to worldwide fame just a few short years later. <br>Drawing on rare and never-before-published archival material, <i>The Millionaire and the Mummies</i>, the first biography of Theodore Davis ever written rehabilitates a tarnished image through a thrilling tale of crime and adventure, filled with larger-than-life characters, unimaginable treasures, and exotic settings.</p></p><p>JOHN M.

He lives in Winchester, Illinois.One <br>&nbsp; <br> <br>THUYU&#x2019;S GOLDEN COFFIN <br>&nbsp; <br>A blockbuster exhibition of ancient art left Egypt and started touring the world in 2004. It stayed on the road for the next decade and was visited by ten million people on four continents. The largest golden object in the show was a massive mummy case1 seven feet long, two feet wide, and forty inches high. The refined, elegantly sculpted face was broad, with a wide nose, a dainty chin, and eyes of obsidian and calcite set in blue glass; it gazed serenely into eternity, a slight smile hovering on its lips. It was sheathed from head to toe in gleaming, beaten reddish gold. The overwhelming size and ostentation made the coffin, if not the most subtle or exquisite piece in the show, perhaps the most imposing. <br>The coffin was made in the royal workshops for a woman named Thuyu who likely bore no resemblance whatever to the face on the cover. Thuyu was perhaps a commoner, perhaps petty nobility. She was a priestess of the god Amen and moved into the palace when her daughter became the Great Royal Wife of the pharaoh known as Amenhotep the Magnificent during Egypt&#x2019;s Eighteenth Dynasty. As a special favor, Thuyu and her husband were given a tomb in the highly exclusive Valley of the Kings. One day around 1370 B.C. Thuyu was placed in the coffin and the coffin was sealed in her tomb. It sat in silence and unremitting darkness for almost 3,300 years. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>The two well-dressed men riding donkeys through the afternoon shadows in the Valley of the Kings on February 12, 1905, might have been tourists&#x2014;an old man and his grandson on a world tour, perhaps, visiting Egypt between stops in Naples and Constantinople. A cold southern wind sent clouds of sand flying around them. The sturdy little animals they rode (the older man using his handmade English saddle) were available for hire by the day or month, but the two were not sightseers; their donkeys had been rented for the digging season because the men were tomb hunters, returning to work after lunch. Both were excited, although their demeanors remained properly restrained and only the constant cigarette puffing by the older man gave away his anxious anticipation. <br>For five days their workmen had been breaking apart and clearing concretelike rubble out of a stairway carved more than three thousand years before into the bedrock of the royal cemetery&#x2014;a stairway found at the bottom of a thirty-foot mound of sand and rock chips that had taken sixty men three weeks to remove. The previous day the crew had reached the top of a doorway and they had spent this morning digging to uncover that. The older man knew the passage might end abruptly in a blank limestone wall, an unfinished mistake abandoned by the ancients. The younger rider dreamed it might lead, as such doors had led his companion twice before, to a pharaoh&#x2019;s tomb. <br>The older man was Theodore Montgomery Davis,2 a sixty-six-year-old American millionaire who had been granted the right to excavate in the valley. Davis&#x2019;s agreement with the Egyptian government gave him the authority to lead the exploration and the obligation to pay for it, a familiar role; in America he had dug a canal, built railroads, cut down forests, and opened iron and silver mines. He was an art collector who socialized with presidents and had erected a mansion for himself in Newport, Rhode Island. He had selected the spot where the stairway was found although, as he later wrote, &#x201c;the site was most unpromising&nbsp;&#x2026; certainly no Egyptologist, exploring with another person&#x2019;s money, would have thought of risking the time and expense.&#x201d;3 <br>He was a fit, wiry man, five feet nine inches tall (average for his day) with hazel eyes that were striking for their direct, appraising gaze. His brown hair was turning white and he wore elaborate muttonchop whiskers that had been stylish in his youth but were now considered old-fashioned. He wore a broad-brimmed hat, an expensive woolen jacket, a vest, and a collar and tie; his legs were protected from the donkey&#x2019;s flanks by puttees and knee-high spats. <br>Davis&#x2019;s companion was twenty-four-year-old British archaeologist Arthur Weigall, the newly hired antiquities inspector for the Egyptian government. Weigall later said Davis tended to regard the valley as his own property, but the young Englishman&#x2019;s job would be to oversee the American&#x2019;s work. Acutely aware of his subordinate position to the older man, Weigall knew that Davis&#x2019;s goodwill would be crucial to his future. <br>For Davis, the relationship was natural to the point of tedium; almost everyone he came in contact with was a subordinate. Davis&#x2019;s wealth ensured that those who met him were invariably conscious of what his favor could provide, and he was far from stingy. The week before, he and his mistress had inspected the building he had constructed for a girls&#x2019; school run by Presbyterian missionaries in Luxor (ancient Thebes), across the Nile from the valley. Once Davis decided a man&#x2014;or a woman, as at the school&#x2014;was reliable, he was generous and charming. Weigall later said that &#x201c;thanks to his good nature, the serenity of our work was ruffled by but few breezes.&#x201d;4 <br>As their donkeys arrived at the excavation site the two men dismounted and eagerly inspected the hole gashed by the ancients into the bedrock.5 Davis&#x2019;s diggers had finished exposing the doorway at the bottom of the steep, thirteen-step stairwell; a stone and mud-mortar wall filled the door space. The men immediately noticed that an opening had been made at the top of the blocking wall, proof that something lay beyond the doorway but also a sign the tomb had been entered by ancient grave robbers. It was an unwelcome indication but not a surprise. Every king&#x2019;s tomb in the valley&#x2014;including the two Davis had already discovered&#x2014;had been robbed millennia before, leaving behind only broken fragments of the riches they had contained when they were first sealed. <br>Night would fall before the workmen could clear the wall blocking the doorway, so Davis ordered a halt for the day and sent all his men home except the <i>reis</i> (the Egyptian foreman). The day before, Davis had called in police to guard the site overnight, knowing the several hundred natives living in poverty and squalor in villages near the valley were as interested as their ancestors had been in acquiring some of the wealth a tomb might provide. Accumulating his fortune had given Davis a keen appreciation of human frailty; his own wealth was the result of intelligence, hard work, and luck coupled with fraud, perjury, and bribery. <br>With the workmen gone, Davis and Weigall inspected the tomb&#x2019;s entry. The doorway at the bottom of the steps was six feet tall and blocked by the wall except for the top eighteen inches, a chin-level opening impossible for them to crawl through without a ladder. Peering through the opening, they saw a steep ramp descending farther into the earth; to one side Davis saw what he thought was a cane lying on the floor. The young son of the <i>reis</i> was enlisted, and with his turban undone and tied under his arms, the boy was lifted up to the opening and then lowered into the chamber. The ramp was clear beyond the door but the space was almost completely empty. The boy handed back through the opening what Davis had seen&#x2014;an ancient staff of office&#x2014;followed by a neck yolk from a chariot and a stone scarab (a religious amulet carved as a beetle) covered in gold foil. The frightened child was hauled back out of the dim chamber after reporting there were no paintings or carvings on the walls. <br>Davis wrapped the objects in his overcoat, secured them to the pommel of his saddle, and headed for home. As he traveled across the plain from the valley back to the Nile he was surprised when some villagers told him they knew he carried the staff of a prince, a large scarab, and a chariot yolk of solid gold. News spread rapidly among the locals, and inconspicuous watchers kept an eye on foreign diggers; Weigall had decided to spend the night at the tomb since it was assumed Egyptian guards could not be relied upon and a European&#x2019;s presence was needed to protect the find. &#x201c;The mouth of a lonely tomb already said by native rumour to contain incalculable wealth,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;is not perhaps the safest place in the world.&#x201d;6 <br>Home for Davis was his <i>dahabiyeh,</i> a unique style of sail-powered houseboat used for travel up and down the Nile. Davis&#x2019;s twin-masted boat had all the opulence of his Newport mansion: a grand piano in the salon, a crystal chandelier in the dining room, a library, four bedrooms, and bathrooms with tubs. A large U.S. flag floated across the stern. The crew of twenty Nubian sailors wore matching white turbans and brown cardigans with the name of their ship&#x2014;the <i>Beduin</i>&#x2014;stitched across the chest in red. The <i>Beduin</i> was tied up to the west bank of the Nile, about three miles from the valley. <br>Seated on deck in one of the brown, hooded wicker chairs decorated with bright yellow and black cushions and arranged around a collection of handmade carpets, waited his companion of the past twenty years, Emma B. Andrews. Emma, a cousin of Davis&#x2019;s absent wife, was a wealthy widow from Columbus, Ohio, and a year older than Davis. Today she would be called his mistress (and that is how Davis&#x2019;s wife referred to her), despite their separate bedrooms in Newport and on the <i>Beduin.</i> She was intelligent, cultured, and unconventional. One of her passions was education for young women; now the champion for the school in Luxor, when she had moved into the mansion with Davis and his wife eighteen years before she had been elected vice president of the Newport Industrial School for Girls. <br>The couple spent every winter in Egypt and preferred to travel with company. On this trip they had brought twenty-three-year-old Jean Hardy from Columbus, a member of Emma&#x2019;s extended family, and Alice Wilson, also in her early twenties and the daughter of Davis&#x2019;s closest friend and business partner. Davis&#x2019;s English valet and Emma&#x2019;s French maid rounded out the party. <br>Arriving at the <i>Beduin,</i> Davis rushed past the cage of live poultry that provided eggs and meat for the five-course dinners served on the boat, past the huge wooden pilings the crew had pounded into the earth to secure the boat to shore, and bounded up the gangplank to share his finds with the ladies. In her journal, Emma wrote that &#x201c;he had an air of great elation,&#x201d; and described what he revealed: &#x201c;a yoke of a chariot, finely decorated in gold and color&#x2014;in perfect condition&nbsp;&#x2026; a wand of office&#x2014;also finely decorated&nbsp;&#x2026; and a large beautiful green, hard stone scarab, with gilded bands, beautifully inscribed even to the wings.&#x201d;7 <br>Davis sent messages to two other <i>dahabiyeh</i>s that were tied up nearby. On board the <i>Miriam</i> was Gaston (later Sir Gaston) Maspero, director general of the Egyptian Service des Antiquities and the supreme authority for all decisions on archaeological work in Egypt. The French-born son of an Italian political exile, Maspero had been a professor of Egyptology in France since 1869 and from 1881 to 1886 had served as head of the service; he had returned to the job in 1899 (with a substantial salary increase). Maspero, recognized as the world&#x2019;s foremost Egyptologist, was returning north to Cairo after an inspection tour and was the man who had approved Davis to excavate in the valley, referring to him as the American Maecenas (the ancient Roman patron of Virgil and Horace). Davis&#x2019;s note invited Maspero to &#x201c;come over and see something worth looking at.&#x201d;8 When he arrived, Maspero said he had already heard in Luxor that afternoon that a tomb had been found in the valley filled with gold. <br>Davis also invited the Reverend Archibald Sayce, an Oxford professor and ordained minister in the Church of England who never wore anything but the black long-skirted clerical costume and three-cornered hat his religious office called for. Sayce, the world&#x2019;s foremost expert on the ancient Hittites, had largely retired from academic life and spent every winter on the Nile excavating different sites and copying inscriptions. His boat had just arrived in Luxor and moored next to Davis. Like most of the scholarly <i>dahabiyeh</i> owners, Sayce had been friends with Davis for years. <br>It was a dramatic and exciting evening on the <i>Beduin,</i> and laughter and applause echoed over the Nile far into the night. Davis reported that the light had not been sufficient to see what lay beyond the ramp into the rest of the tomb. All agreed that the most likely explanation for the presence of the treasures on the ramp was that the ancient robbers had emerged from looting the burial chamber into better light and discovered the objects were not solid gold but only covered in gold foil. As they examined the finds under the crystal chandelier in the salon, decorated with its Morris green brocades and art fabrics, the group on the <i>Beduin</i> could only speculate on what else such picky burglars might have left behind. <br>Maspero was most excited by the chariot yoke, since no complete ancient Egyptian chariot had ever been recovered. Mostly, the group speculated about whose tomb they had found. &#x201c;We had not the slightest clue,&#x201d; Davis wrote.9 None of the objects carried a name, although they clearly came from the ancient royal workshops. <br>Maspero asked if the tomb could be opened the next day. He had received a telegram from Lord Cromer (the British consul general who actually governed Egypt) saying Queen Victoria&#x2019;s third son would be in Luxor the following afternoon, and the Frenchman was eager to benefit his position with the British by presenting the Duke of Connaught and his party with a noteworthy event. Davis quickly agreed. No one found it easy to sleep that night, as visions of what might lie beyond the tomb&#x2019;s door kept the explorers awake. <br>Another of Davis&#x2019;s friends joined Weigall at the mouth of the tomb that night when American artist Joseph Lindon Smith and his wife, Corinna (of the publishing Putnam family), arrived to camp out with the inspector and the half dozen Egyptian guards. Joe Smith, a forty-one-year-old native of Pawtucket, Rhode Island, had studied art in Boston and Paris and dedicated his career to painting the architectural glories of the past. Like Davis, he spent winters working in Egypt; the two had known each other for several years. Davis, whom Smith described as &#x201c;an eccentric, brusque little man but a good friend to people he liked,&#x201d;10 had already promised Smith he would be among the first to see any new discovery. Weigall recalled they slept fitfully until the dawn, although Corinna Smith told Emma the night had been one of the most beautiful she had ever spent, despite the cold; she had risen early to make tea and watch the sunrise from a hilltop. <br> <br> <i>Davis&#x2019;s yacht, the </i>Beduin, <i> photographed 1902. Reproduced with permission of the Semitic Museum, Harvard University, Lyon Photo No. 142.</i> <br>Davis awoke as usual the next morning when his valet brought him his juice and laid out his clothes for the day; Emma and the girls were awakened by her maid. When the situation called for it, Davis would trade his donkey for a hired carriage, and after a hurried breakfast on Monday, February 13, a stream of carriages left the Nileside moorings of the <i>dahabiyeh</i>s. Emma rode with Alice Wilson, who had been ill for several days but could not bear to miss the opening of the tomb, and Davis rode with Sayce. The men chatted nervously as they crossed the country to the valley. Davis told Sayce a story he was particularly fond of, about the time he asked his friend and Newport neighbor Alexander Agassiz, a noted naturalist, why he thought the Almighty had made living things. &#x201c;To eat each other,&#x201d; had been Aga...</p><h2>The Enchanted Wood Collection: Three Exciting Stories in One</h2><p>Dean 2002 1st Thus Very Good in dw jacket Pictorial laminated boards.

By the author of Captiva. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>Randy White's mysteries are tailor-made for fans who've exhausted the novels of the late John D. MacDonald. White's series hero, Doc Ford, a marine biologist whose r�sum� includes a Vietnam-era stint with the Special Forces, is a somewhat cynical philosopher whose toughness masks a tender heart; he's a worthy successor to Travis McGee. In this fast-paced, well-written thriller, a nearly forgotten promise to a long-dead comrade gets Doc involved in a daughter's search for her mother. Gail Richardson's house is empty, and so are her bank accounts. Her daughter Amanda is sure that Gail's being held against her will by her would-be protector, Jackie Merlot, a mysterious man whose connections reach deep into Central and South America. The trail leads from Florida to Colombia and then to Panama, site of a private, heavily guarded retreat catering to the perverse tastes of the wealthy and powerful. Getting in takes all Doc's skill and cunning. Getting out is another matter entirely, as he learns with the help of a few of Bobby Richardson's old Vietnam buddies who turn up in the proverbial nick of time. The denouement is full of surprises, including one that even the most discerning reader won't see coming. The writing is swift, deft, and full of the crunchy nuggets of world-weary wisdom that admirers of the MacDonald genre loved and that White's growing number of devoted readers have come to expect. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Randy Wayne White is the author of seventeen previous Doc Ford novels and four collections of nonfiction.

Donaldson changed the face of fantasy fiction forever. In </i>The Mirror of Her Dreams<i>, the astonishing first novel in the two-volume Mordant&#x2019;s Need series, Donaldson shows us a world of wondrous beauty and seductive illusion, where mirrors hold the deadliest of magics and nothing is what it seems. . . .<br><br></i></b>The daughter of rich but neglectful parents, Terisa Morgan lives alone in a New York City apartment, a young woman who has grown to doubt her own existence. Surrounded by the flat reassurance of mirrors, she leads an unfulfilled life&#x2014;until the night a strange man named Geraden comes crashing through one of her mirrors, on a quest to find a champion to save his kingdom of Mordant from a pervasive evil that threatens the land. Terisa is no champion. She wields neither magic nor power. And yet, much to her own surprise, when Geraden begs her to come back with him, she agrees.<br><br>Now, in a culture where women are little more than the playthings of powerful men, in a castle honeycombed with secret passages and clever traps, in a kingdom threatened from without and within by enemies able to appear and vanish out of thin air, Terisa must become more than the pale reflection of a person. For the way back to Earth is closed to her. And the enemies of Mordant will stop at nothing to see her dead.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Once again Stephen R. Donaldson, has created a shining example that proves his gift as a master storyteller. It is the story of Terisa Morgan and Geraden, son of the Domme, set in the strange land called Mordant.

Finberg Director of the Institute for Research on Women and Gender, Stanford University.Much has been written about discrimination against women in science, including assertions that brain size and temperament precluded their ability to study and succeed. Schiebinger (History/Penn State; The Mind Has No Sex?, 1989) adds considerably more: She concentrates on 17th- and 18th-century European developments in taxonomy and physical anthropology to show how the European male became the prototype of the human race; how women were reduced to a subset noted only for sexual differences; and how people of color were placed at inferior levels of the great chain of being, on a par with apes. By celebrating sexuality in plants, Erasmus, Darwin, and Linneaus did much to set the stage for thinking of females in terms of sexuality alone--leading Linneaus to choose the term ``mammals'' to distinguish the order of warmblooded, hairy animals--but also to underscore women's role as nurturing caretakers. More shocking was the scholars' concern with female genitalia and sexual characteristics. The ideal breast was the pointed hemisphere of the European female, and Circassian women set the standard for beauty- -hence the name ``Caucasian'' for the white race. Pendulous breasts were inferior--and African; so were enlarged labia. It appears that collectors and dissectors had a field day measuring vaginal angles and clitoral lengths, and attributing massive labia to various African females, including the ``Hottentot Venus'' brought to Europe for study. For most readers, it's bad enough to know that Aristotle and other ancient and medieval scholars were dupes to fable and traveler's tales. To learn that the dawn of modern science was equally clouded by politics, prejudice--and prurience- -won't surprise feminist scholars but is disheartening. Schiebinger concludes with fresh insights on who should do science, as well as with further dismal accounts of tales of 20th- century bias. The very fact that she and others have enriched the record by their scholarly expos&#x201a;s, however, offers hope for the future. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Offering scenes from his life that are at times poignant, revelatory, frightening, soul-stirring, painful, funny, and uplifting, <em>That Bird Has My Wings</em> tells the story of the author&#x2019;s childhood with parents addicted to heroin, an abusive foster family, a life of crime and imprisonment, and the eventual embracing of Buddhism.</p><p><p>Jarvis Jay Masters has taken an extraordinary journey of faith. Strangely enough, his moment of enlightenment came behind the bars of San Quentin's death row. In this compelling memoir, inmate and author Jarvis Jay Masters takes us from the arms of his heroin-addicted mother to an abusive foster home, on his escape to the illusory freedom of the streets and through lonely nights spent in bus stations and juvenile homes, and finally to life inside the walls of San Quentin State Prison. Using the nub and filler from a ballpoint pen (the only writing instrument allowed him in solitary confinement), Masters chronicles the story of a bright boy who turns to a life of crime, and of a penitent man who embraces Buddhism to find hope in this ultimately inspirational story. </p><p>Masters has written his remarkable story as a cautionary tale for anyone who might be tempted to follow in his footsteps, and as a plea for under-standing to a world that too often ignores the plight of the forgotten members of society. His personal story dramatically reminds us all that freedom and opportunity are not to be taken for granted, and that no matter what their neighborhood, no matter what their race, <em>every</em> child matters.</p><p>An inmate at San Quentin since the age of nineteen, Jarvis Jay Masters is the author of <em>Finding Freedom</em> as well as many articles. In 1992, Masters won a PEN Award for his poem "Recipe for Prison Pruno." </p><p>In 1990, Masters was moved to death row after being convicted of conspiracy in the murder of a prison guard. In April 2008, the California Supreme Court ordered an evidentiary hearing based on the lack of substantial evidence for Masters's conviction.Many people believe in Masters's innocence and are actively working within the legal system to free him.</p></p><h2>The Ghosts of K2: The Epic Saga of the First Ascent</h2><p><b> Downright thrilling; [Conefrey] really gives us a sense of what it must have been like, battling exhaustion and frigid temperatures to get to the top of the world . A must-read.&#x201d;<br><i> Booklist </i></b><br><br>At 28,251 ft, K2 might be almost 800 ft shorter than Everest, but it&#x2019;s a far harder climb. In this definitive account, Mick Conefrey grippingly describes the early attempts to reach the summit and provides a fascinating exploration of the first ascent&#x2019;s complex legacy. From the drug-addicted occultist Aleister Crowley to Achille Compagnoni and Lindo Lacedelli, the Italian duo who finally made it to the summit, The Ghosts of K2 charts how a slew of great men became fixated on this legendary mountain.<br><br>Through exclusive interviews with surviving team members and their families, and unrivalled access to diaries and letters that have been archived around the world, Conefrey evokes the true atmosphere of the Savage Mountain and explores why it remains the mountaineer&#x2019;s mountain&#x2019;, despite a history steeped in controversy and death. Wrought with tension, and populated by tragic heroes and eccentric dreamers, The Ghosts of K2 is a masterpiece of mountaineering literature.<br></p><p><b>Mick Conefrey</b> is the author of <i>Everest 1953</i>, <i>How to Climb Mont Blanc in a Skirt,</i> and <i>The Adventurer&#x2019;s Handbook</i>. An internationally recognized filmmaker, he has produced several BBC documentaries on mountaineering and exploration, including the prize-winning <i>The Ghosts of K2.</i> He lives in Oxford, U.K."An absorbing chronicle of K2's early history that all fans of mountaineering will enjoy..... This exhilarating book traces the climbing history of K2, the world's second tallest peak at 28,251 feet, and offers a new twist to its controversial first ascent."<br><b><i> Library Journal</i></b><br><br>"Conefrey ably tells the story of the many attempts by hardy souls (and outsized characters) to reach the peak of this most formidable mountain. .... [He] writes skillfully about mountaineering, and he knows its history and its many players, stars and bit actors alike. He successfully conveys the complexity and obstacles that these brave men faced.... Conefrey makes the stakes clear and reveals the many rivalries and tensions that plagued even the best-equipped teams.... Most of us will never experience K2. Conefrey leaves readers with both tremendous admiration for and an appreciation of the consequences for those who succeed in an adventure so physically, mentally, and emotionally taxing.&#x201d;<br><b><i> Kirkus Reviews </i></b><br><br>"Drawing from newly unearthed archival material, Conefrey fleshes out the stories of the first expeditions to K2, which have been clouded in mystery and conflicting stories, and resolves some long-standing controversies. Further, his depiction of the first successful attempt to reach the summit, which came only slightly more than a year after Everest was finally topped, is downright thrilling; he really gives us a sense of what it must have been like, battling exhaustion and frigid temperatures to get to the top of the world. The book also has a few thought-provoking surprises, like this one: Aleister Crowley, the famed British occultist, was a member of the first recorded expedition to K2, in 1902. For fans of books about climbing, this one&#x2019;s a must-read."<br><b><i> Booklist</i></b><br><br>"Conefrey brilliantly evokes the danger and strangeness of high-altitude climbing...In this fascinating and poignant book, [he] ventures into a liminal zone: of dreams, controversies and unquiet ghosts.'<br><b><i> The Spectator</i></b><br><br>" Only unbridled ambition is going to get you up K2. And the stories of the early attempts and the eventual success illustrate the complexity of the mountain and the climbers who chose to risk it all. <b>GHOSTS OF K2</b> brings them back to life."<br><b> Peter Edmund Hillary, mountaineer, expedition leader, philanthropist and author of <i>In the Ghost Country</i></b><br><br>"There is a haunting tone to the very name K2, this impossible mountain upon the flanks of which so many lives have been lost. In this wonderful book Mick Conefrey manages to turn the sound of tragedy into a celebration of hope, a triumph of the spirit."<br><b> Wade Davis, author of <i>Into the Silence: The Great War, Mallory and the Conquest of Everest</i></b><br><br>"Six expeditions drawn from two continents and three countries and spread out over a half century attempted to reach the summit of the world's second highest mountain. Six climbers died in those attempts. Bitter controversies arose as to who was to blame for death and failure. Even the expedition that finally pulled off the first ascent in 1954 sparked a dispute between its leading members that played out for the next half century. Mick Conefrey judiciously and lucidly unravels this tangled tale of courage and conflict. And he displays, once again as in his earlier works, a consummate ability to tell a ripping good climbing yarn."<br><b> Maurice Isserman, co-author of <i>Fallen Giants: A History of Himalayan Mountaineering from the Age of Empire to the Age of Extremes</i></b><br><br>"K2, as I know from personal experience of climbing it, is a seriously dangerous mountain. The second highest peak, yet perhaps the first prize to any serious mountaineer. This book engagingly portrays the grim, fascinating, tragic history of K2."<br><b> Alan Hinkes OBE, mountaineer and author of <i>8000m: Climbing the World&#x2019;s Highest Mountains</i></b><br><br>"Calamity, chaos, catastrophe, controversy, calumny the history of the most difficult and dangerous of high Himalayan peaks has all these in spades. Mick Conefrey relates the often unedifying, occasionally heroic saga leading to its first ascent with great panache and lucid analysis of little-known material. A significant contribution to mountaineering historical writing."<br><b> Jim Perrin, award-winning author of <i>The Villain: The Life of Don Whillans</i> and <i>Snowdon: The Story of a Welsh Mountain</i></b><br><br> If <b>GHOSTS OF K2</b> has a hero, surely it is Charlie Houston, prime mover of the American 1938 and 1953 attempts, whose 'credo, lived out on his expeditions,' was that 'the way in which you make an attempt is as important as whether you get to the top'&#x201d; It&#x2019;s a shame that more of K2&#x2019;s other protagonists weren&#x2019;t able to extend the dignity of that motto to encompass their post-expedition comportment.&#x201d;<br><b> Gregory Crouch in <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>"The amateur and professional climbers Conefrey chronicles are so uniformly interesting and in some cases strange that they each deserve a separate book, but together they suggest the obsession of the lure of mountains. In the end, <b>THE GHOSTS OF K2</b> is a history of more than a half-century of mountain climbing. Recommended."<br><b> CHOICE Magazine </b></p><h2>The Human Comedy</h2><p>The Human Comedy, Saroyan&#39;s first novel, is the story of an American family in wartime, and in particular of Homer Macauley, the fastest messenger in San Joaquin valley. With all the qualities of warmth, cheer, and humanity which have endeared Saroyan to his reading public, The Human Comedy abounds in unforgettable scenes. Homer running the Two-Twenty hurdles; little Ulysses imprisoned in a bear trap in Covington&#39;s store; old-time telegraph operator Willie Grogan, with a bottle in the desk drawer to fuzz the sharp reality of the everflowing messages of love and hope and pain and death; Spangler, with a love for the whole world and every living thing; Homer&#39;s older brother Marcus singing, as the troop train in which he sits hurtles away from home. Saroyan has done many things, but he has here done something which even his oldest friends scarcely dared to predict -- a wartime novel of the home front which succeeds in capturing, and which nowhere oversteps, the modesty of ordinary human beings. It is a very simple novel. It is a very great achievement.

Then the author shreds the tale to academic ribbons using the latest findings on each subject. Each true story sets the record straight, reveals timeless ulterior motives, introduces important personalities who successfully (and suspiciously) avoided responsibility in common history texts, and notes underlining issues that have continued relevance in the modern age. For instance, did Nero really fiddle as Rome burned? Did Paul Revere actually alert the militia that the British were coming? Did the Catholic Church imprison Galileo because his teachings conflicted with the Bible? Weir takes on all these myths and tells the reader what really happened. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><p><p>William Weir is the author of several history books, including <i>Written with Lead, Fatal Victories, A Well Regulated Militia, Soldiers in the Shadows, Turning Points in Military History, Fifty Weapons that Changed Warfare, </i>and <i>Fifty Military Leaders Who Changed the World</i>.&nbsp; He lives in Guilford, Connecticut.</p><b>Publishers Weekly, February 9, 2009</b>&#x201c;In historian Weir's newest, he examines and debunks popular historical myths, trimming the proceedings in a textbook-like assemblage of color illustrations and sidebars. Weir cites numerous sources while restoring historical accuracy to popular legends, including Nero's fiddling, the &#x201c;unconquerable&#x201d; Afghanistan and Paul Revere's ride. Though largely well-written and meticulously researched, Weir stretches mightily to incorporate some of his investigations; his look at Jesse James in particular rings false, citing an &#x201c;American Robin Hood&#x201d; myth that Weir may as well have made up (has anyone ever argued that James <i>wasn't</i> a vicious murderer and thief?). A few more stories like this unfortunately detract from the strong entries; especially illuminating are the passages on Wyatt Earp and John Dillinger. Though there are surprises to be found for history buffs, knowledgeable readers will find enough off-track editorializing and fluff to question some of Weir's more salient and interesting points."<br><br><b>Bookviews.com, February 2009</b>&#x201c;I love reading history, so I was naturally intrigued by William Weir&#x2019;s <i>History&#x2019;s Greatest Lies</i> in which he neatly dispatches many of the most treasured stories to be found in the schoolbooks and repeated elsewhere. Weir relates that Emperor Nero did not fiddle as Rome burned because the fiddle or violin wasn&#x2019;t invented until the 16th century. His enemies are the source of that story and he had plenty of them. Paul Revere did his best to alert the extensive Colonial militia that the British were coming, but they got to him first, holding him for awhile as the word was spread by a variety of means. The Bastille was stormed because the crowd wanted to get at its store of gunpowder. Its political prisoners actually lived in comfortable quarters. All things considered, this book provides a very interesting new look at history.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Sword of the Lictor</h2><p>When Severian, the Torturer, sets a woman free from prison, he is forced to flee and experiences many strange adventures in the distant future of Earth</p><p>No Bio<br><br>No Bio</p><h2>The Fly-Tying Bible</h2><p>With a double-page spread devoted to each pattern, featuring step-by-step instructions in full colour, and ring bound so that it will lie flat on the bench or table top beside the fly-tying vice, this is a reference book for anglers who wish to tie their own versions of the most successful patterns in current use. The book starts with an introduction to fly-tying basics, material, equipment and techniques. The flies themselves are divided into five categories, Dry Flies, Nymphs and Bugs, Wet Flies, Streamers and Hairwings and covers patterns that have a proven record of success in catching rainbow and brown trout, sea trout, salmon and grayling in rivers and lakes throughout the world. On each spread there is a key indicating which species the fly is designed to attract, a brief description of when and how it should be used, a full-colour photograph of the finished fly indicating the materials used for body, rib, hackle, and so on, the range of hook sizes for which the pattern is suitable and, on the facing page, step-by-step instructions for tying.</p><p>Peter Gathercole is one of Britain&#39;s leading fly-dressers, he is also a popular writer and photographer of articles and books on game fishing.

Here was a group that looked as though it came not only from another era, but also from another planet-a band in which art, fashion, and music would combine to create, in Bryan Ferry's words, above all, a state of mind.&#x201d; Written with the assistance, for the first time, of all those involved, including Bryan Ferry, Brian Eno, Andy Mackay, and Phil Manzanera, <i>Re-Make/Re-Model</i> tells how Pop Art, the 1960s underground, and Swinging London were transformed into a unique sound and look-theatrical, arch, literate, clever, sexy, thrilling. In the tradition of Jean Stein and George Plimpton's <i>Edie</i>, <i>Re-Make/Re-Model</i> is the story of extraordinary individuals and exceptional creativity-and nothing less than the history of an era in music and pop culture.</p><p><b>Michael Bracewell</b> is an acclaimed novelist as well as nonfiction writer. He lives in England.In this innovative and intelligent book, British novelist and essayist Bracewell (<i>The Nineties: When Surface Was Depth</i>) explores how the 1972 release of the eponymously named debut album by Roxy Music&#x2014;a manifesto written in the language of heavily stylized, nuanced and atmospheric pop and rock music&#x2014;was actually the culmination of a decade-long British movement in which fine art and the avant-garde met the vivacity of pop and fashion with the goal of dissolving the boundaries between high and low art forms. Bracewell describes in fascinating detail a range of famous and obscure artists, first in the fine arts departments at Newcastle and Reading universities and later in the London of the swinging '60s, and delivers in effect a history of the British pop art movement, with special praise for the influence of artist Richard Hamilton at Newcastle, with whom Roxy Music's Bryan Ferry studied. By the time Bracewell ends his look at Roxy Music at its moment of becoming, he has definitively shown how the roots of Ferry's artistic vision of the band, both as a musical group and as a pop art concept, helped him produce one of the most original groups of its time, fusing an eclectic range of influences from modern music, popular culture and fine art <i>(Dec.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Exploring the halls of intellectual inquiry and stardom he encountered after the publication of his seminal work, <em>The Selfish Gene</em>; affectionately lampooning the world of academia, publishing, and television; and studding the pages with funny stories about the great men and women he&#x2019;s known, Dawkins offers a candid look at the events and ideas that encouraged him to shift his attention to the intersection of culture, religion, and science. He also invites the reader to look more closely at the brilliant succession of ten influential books that grew naturally out of his busy life, highlighting the ideas that connect them and excavating their origins.</p><p>On the publication of his tenth book, the smash hit, <em>The God Delusion</em>, a &#x201c;resounding trumpet blast for truth&#x201d; (Matt Ridley), Richard Dawkins was catapulted from mere intellectual stardom into a circle of celebrity thinkers dubbed, &#x201c;The New Atheists&#x201d;&#x2014;including Christopher Hitchens, Sam Harris, and Daniel Dennett.</p><p>Throughout <em>A Brief Candle in the Dark</em>, Dawkins shares with us his infectious sense of wonder at the natural world, his enjoyment of the absurdities of human interaction, and his bracing awareness of life&#x2019;s brevity: all of which have made a deep imprint on our culture.</p></p><p><p>Richard Dawkins was first catapulted to fame with his iconic work <em>The Selfish Gene</em>, which he followed with a string of bestselling books.

In the same year, Richard Dawkins appeared in the BBC Four television series <em>Beautiful Minds</em>, revealing how he came to write <em>The Selfish Gene</em> and speaking about some of the events covered in this autobiography.</p><p>In 2013, Dawkins was voted the world's top thinker in <em>Prospect</em> magazine's poll of over 10,000 readers from over 100 countries.</p>&#x201c;If anyone in modern science deserves to regard his or her own contribution with pride, even with triumph, it is Richard Dawkins...

But Clara had more than her share of difficulties in life: She was separated from her mother at age five when her parents divorced; and although her father was a good music teacher, he was also controlling and overbearing, forbidding Clara's marriage to Robert Schumann. In straightforward prose, Allman chronicles Clara's refusal to give up her concert career after marriage, despite the conventions of the times. Robert suffered a complete mental breakdown and died years before Clara; the author makes plain to readers that throughout this tragedy, as in all aspects of Clara's life, music was her solace. A fine introduction to a strong, disciplined artist. Haas's black-and-white illustrations feature unusual compositions and fit the text well.

It&#x2019;s Paris, 1895. A Jewish army officer, Alfred Dreyfus, has been convicted of treason and is imprisoned on Devil&#x2019;s Island; he has been publicly humiliated, bound in chains, banished to solitary confinement. But was he really a spy for Germany--or was his fate sealed because he was a Jew in an anti-Semitic time and place? Slowly, the petit bureaucrat Georges Picquart begins to suspect that Dreyfus--portrayed here mostly through heart-wrenching real-life letters he wrote from prison to his beloved family--has been scapegoated. As Picquart amasses more and more evidence about Dreyfus, he also must come to terms with some of his own behaviors and attitudes. Still, for all its delicious detail about the mores of Belle Epoque Paris, both social and political, this novel is also one for the ages, or at least for the ages in which powerful intelligence agencies, government surveillance and cover-ups are worrisomely becoming the norm. <em>--Sara Nelson</em></p><p>ROBERT HARRIS is one of Britain's most famous writers of thriller novels and gripping historical fiction.

Inside the car were four men dressed like government officials in dark suits and ill-fitting fedoras.</p> <p>As the road started to climb into the Carpathians near the border with Romania, the men met another car coming down the hill toward them. The car was limping along with a puncture, but when the black sedan stopped it was not to offer help.</p> <p>"Where is Academician Vavilov?" one of the four men shouted from the car window. "We must find Academician Vavilov."</p> <p>In the second car was a young botanist, Vadim Lekhnovich, a member of a Commissariat of Agriculture expedition led by the Soviet Union's chief geneticist and plant breeder, Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov. It was August 6, 1940. Europe was in flames, the Battle of Britain was engaged, but western Ukraine was basking peacefully in the summer sun. The botanists had been in the fields looking for rare specimens of wild grasses that could be bred into new forms of wheat able to withstand the inhospitable climates of the northern steppes.</p> <p>For Lekhnovich, the intensity of the men in the black sedan, even the rude one who was shouting, had broken into their peaceful pursuit of plant hunting, but the urgent request for Nikolai Ivanovich did not seem out of the ordinary. Vavilov was an important scientist who was frequently summoned to Moscow at short notice.</p> <p>"Nikolai Ivanovich is with the others, collecting specimens," Lekhnovich called back. "Is there an emergency?"</p> <p>The man in the black sedan glared and spat out an answer.</p> <p>"Academician Vavilov has important official documents about grain exports. They are needed immediately at the Commissariat of Agriculture."</p> <p>The cold, demanding voice was suddenly unsettling. This was no idle bureaucrat.</p> <p>"Where is Academician Vavilov?" the man demanded again.</p> <p>"Tell us where we can find him."</p> <p>"He is with the others, in a field farther up the mountain -- " Lekhnovich began, but before he could finish, the black sedan accelerated away, the dust billowing.</p> <p>Lekhnovich coaxed his crippled vehicle back down the mountain to Chernovtsy and the university hostel where they were all staying.</p> <p>At dusk, Nikolai Ivanovich returned with his botanists to the hostel. The four men in the black sedan were waiting for him. As he got out of his car, the door of the black sedan opened, and one of the men jumped out. He began talking earnestly with Nikolai Ivanovich, who then got into the sedan and it drove off. The guard at the hostel, who had overheard the conversation, reported to the botanists that the men told Nikolai Ivanovich he was needed urgently in Moscow. He had gone with them, saying that he would return.</p> <p>Shortly before midnight, two of the four men returned to the Chernovtsy hostel. They carried a note for Lekhnovich from Vavilov, penned in his own distinctive handwriting.</p> <p>"In view of my sudden recall to Moscow, hand over all my things to the bearer of this note. N. Vavilov, August 6, 1940, 2315 hours."</p> <p>The two men insisted, politely but firmly, that all Vavilov's belongings should be put into his suitcase, not leaving anything out, not even a scrap of paper. They said that Vavilov was already at the airport and was waiting for his belongings before flying to Moscow.</p> <p>Lekhnovich and another of the botanists, Fatikh Bakhteyev, did as they were told. As they packed the papers, even scraps of Vavilov's notes, they wondered why Nikolai Ivanovich had not been given a chance to pack his own bag, or, more importantly, to give instructions to the staff on how to continue the expedition in his absence. They decided that one of them should accompany the bags to the airport to get the orders directly.</p> <p>Bakhteyev volunteered to go. They took the luggage out to the car where the men were waiting, one of them already at the wheel. Bakhteyev started to explain why he had to go with them and began to get into the car. But as he opened the door, one of the men forced Bakhteyev out of the way, pushed him to the ground, and jumped into the sedan as it drove off.</p> <p>Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov had disappeared into Stalin's prisons.Copyright � 2008 by Peter Pringle</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b>Introduction</b></p> <p>When I was a correspondent in Moscow in the last days of communism, I lived on a street named for Dmitry Ulyanov, Lenin's brother. Other streets nearby were a Who's Who of the old USSR and its socialist allies, even Ho Chi Minh. Many of the names meant nothing to me. Ulitsa Vavilova, Vavilov Street, was a mystery until one day a Russian friend told me the story of the Vavilov brothers.</p> <p>The street had been named for Sergei Ivanovich Vavilov, a physicist of great renown. He became Stalin's president of the Academy of Sciences at the end of the Second World War and oversaw the beginnings of the Russian atomic bomb project. But it was Sergei's older brother, Nikolai, who was an even greater scientist and who was actually more famous, my friend said. Nikolai Vavilov was a botanist and geneticist, a plant breeder, an intrepid explorer, and an organizer of science. He had an ambitious plan to end famine throughout the world. He wanted to use the new science of genetics to breed varieties that would grow where none had survived before. The key was a treasure trove of genes he was sure he could find in the unknown and wild types that had been ignored by our ancestors as they started farming more than ten thousand years ago. To cultivate these crops, the early farmers selected the seeds of plants that looked strong and yielded more grain -- visible characteristics. But Vavilov was looking for the complex properties, such as the ability to withstand extremes of temperature and resistance to pests.</p> <p>In the 1920s, Nikolai Vavilov roamed the world hunting for these wild varieties of wheat, corn, rye, and potatoes. He built the first international seed bank of food plants, a magnificent collection of hundreds of thousands of botanical specimens, a living library of the world's genetic diversity that would preserve species from extinction and could be used to breed his new miracle plants.</p> <p>Nikolai's fame spread far beyond Russia, my friend told me. He was a leader of the biological world of the early twentieth century. His seed bank was the envy of his colleagues in Europe and America and they came to work with him at his plant breeding Institute in Leningrad.</p> <p>In the first years after the 1917 revolution, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin understood the ultimate economic power of Nikolai Vavilov's dream -- to push Russia into the forefront of world food production -- and he supported Vavilov's expeditions. But Lenin died in 1924, and his successor, Josef Stalin, had a very different priority. Russians were starving. Stalin's forced collectivization of Russian agriculture had disrupted the harvests, and a widespread famine would claim millions of lives. The shortage of food was also a constant threat to the revolution.</p> <p>Stalin gave Vavilov three years to produce his new miracle plants -- an impossible task, as Vavilov knew. To breed improved varieties using the new science of genetics took ten to twelve years. Impatient and ruthless, Stalin charged the geneticists like Vavilov with treason, called them "wreckers" and "saboteurs." They were jailed or executed. Vavilov died of starvation in 1943 in jail. "Just imagine," said my Russian friend, "the man who wanted to feed the world died of hunger in Stalin's prisons."</p> <p>For many years in the Soviet Union you couldn't read Vavilov's scientific papers or even mention his name, my friend continued. But after Stalin died in 1953, Vavilov was "rehabilitated" -- pardoned -- and his reputation as a great scientist restored. The street near my Moscow home was named for his brother, Sergei, but Nikolai Vavilov is the one who is remembered all over Russia today. He has many memorials and plaques where he lived in St. Petersburg, and where he died in prison in Saratov on the Volga.</p> <p>"And so, there you have it," my Russian friend had concluded, "a Shakespearean tragedy about two brothers, two brilliant scientists caught in revolution, civil war, and Stalin's terror, where one is destroyed by the regime and the other becomes a tool of it."</p> <p>The story of the Vavilov brothers, like so many other seductive Russian sagas, leaves the listener wondering how much is true, and how much folklore. What began for me as idle curiosity about a street's name turned into a long and fascinating path of discovery about the violent birth of genetics in Russia, a path that would also reveal an intimate portrait of a bourgeois Russian family trying desperately to survive revolution, civil war, and Stalin's terror.<br></p> <p>Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov was a <i>bogatyr</i>, as the Russians say, a man of incredible powers, a Hercules. He was indeed an international figure, a fearless explorer, a plant hunter who saw more varieties of food plants in their place of origin than any other botanist in his time. His collection of seeds from five continents captivated the scientific world.</p> <p>In the early years of the genetic revolution, Vavilov changed the way scientists looked at their new bounty -- the world's vast store of valuable plant genes. Now, in the age of biotech agriculture it seems obvious to us that if you want to create a better, sturdier variety of corn or wheat, you should explore the total genetic diversity of the botanical kingdom for those exotic genes. But back then, as scientists debated the practical use of Mendel's laws of heredity and the words "gene" and "genetics" had only just entered the vocabulary,Vavilov' concepts were radical and innovative.</p> <p>Before biotechnology and even before Watson and Crick had broken the genetic code, Vavilov laid out a grand plan for "sculpting" plants to human needs, for synthesizing varieties unknown in nature. He opened the eyes of the world's plant hunters and breeders to new ways of applying their expertise, forcing them to think outside the limits of a s...</p></p><h2>Right Wing Women</h2><p>Argues that the Amercian political right mobilizes women by exploiting their fears, and discusses the issues of abortion, sexual equality, anti-Semitism, and anti-feminism</p><p></p><h2>Gate of the Sun</h2><p><p><i>Gate of the Sun: Bab al-Shams </i>is the first true magnum opus of the Palestinian saga.

In 93 previous seasons, the Wildcat football record was a miserable 299-510-40. The program had earned exactly one league title, that coming in 1934, well before Snyder was born. In the years just prior to Snyder�&#x201a;�&#x2019;s arrival, the Wildcats had slumped to their worst, even by K-State standards. The program had lost 13 games in a row, and except for one tie, and had not rung the victory bell in 27 games. Seventeen years later, Snyder�&#x201a;�&#x2019;s orchestration of the greatest turnaround in college football history defines the American dream of achieving the unimaginable. This is his story, from Bill Snyder�&#x201a;�&#x2019;s unique viewpoint, of the process by which he helped transform a program considered the laughingstock of college football into one that won 136 games over seventeen years including eleven bowl appearances and seven seasons of at least ten wins. It�&#x201a;�&#x2019;s also the story of Snyder�&#x201a;�&#x2019;s own triumphant journey, one that forced him at a young age to deal with his own lack of discipline and academic shortcomings in a single-parent family, one that saw him climb to the top of big-time college football, and one that ultimately brought him face-to-face with the toughest decision of his life. Bill Snyder: They Said It Couldn't Be Done captures, in Snyder�&#x201a;�&#x2019;s candid, upfront style, the action behind the scenes in running a major college football program, the strategies employed by early K-State coaches to change the culture of losing that had permeated an entire university, and the magic with which Snyder pulled off the Miracle in Manhattan.</p><p>Mark Janssen has been in the middle of Kansas State Wildcat athletics for the better part of four decades. He has been sports editor of The Manhattan Mercury since 1981, winning six national writing awards from the National Newspaper Association, and eight first-place honors from the Kansas Press Association. Graduating from K-State in 1972, Janssen served as sports director of KMAN-KMKF Radio in Manhattan, earning Sportscaster of the Year honors in 1977 and 1978. He worked alongside the legendary Voice of the Wildcats, Dev Nelson, on the K-State Radio Network, plus hosted several coaches�&#x201a;�&#x2019; television shows. In the first 17 years of Janssen�&#x201a;�&#x2019;s coverage of K-State football, the Wildcats went 46-130-3 under four different coaches. In the last 17 years of Janssen�&#x201a;�&#x2019;s coverage under Coach Bill Snyder, the Wildcats�&#x201a;�&#x2019; record was 136-68-1. Janssen resides in Manhattan with his wife, Peg.

Since there is relatively little information on how to talk about social information, this book redefines what it means to &#34;be social&#34; and it is likely not what you were thinking! This book is a &#34;get real&#34; discussion about what really goes on inside the mind of people as we share space together. There are many practical strategies to help the reader figure out what type of impression they are making on others and what things they could work on to be more successful. Who doesn&#39;t think they could improve in these skills? From discussing the &#34;ins and outs&#34; of what it means to be a &#34;Social Thinker&#34; and use &#34;related social skills,&#34; to figuring out texting, dating, the many different levels of friendship and the many and varied emotions we experience as we relate to others, the authors describe the &#34;real world&#34; of being with other people. This includes figuring out how to sometimes just &#34;fake it&#34; better! The authors are not trying to get every reader to find a group to hang out with; instead they are providing information to help each person find their place and be appreciated by others at whatever level they feel comfortable with.

In measured, detailed language, and drawing on nine years of research, Wheildon discusses page layout, typefaces, reader behavior, and more. Further, given subject matter that lends itself to insightful illustration, he accompanies the text with graphics that enhance and underscore his points at every turn. His writing seems a bit technical, even dry, at first, but detailed and crisp exposition combine with apt illustration to impart as much depth about the technical aspects of presenting printed communication as many readers may want. <i>Mike Tribby</i>Many established typesetting routines actually inhibit reading comprehension: Type &amp; Layout is the message in a fine guide which should be required reading for any involved in pairing written words with art.

E. Marshall</h2><p>Unabridged audiobook in MP3 format.</p><p>Henrietta Elizabeth Marshall (usually credited as H. E. Marshall (1867&#x2013;1941) was a British author, particularly well known for her works of popular national history for children. She was born in Bo'ness, Scotland, and her father was John Marshall JP, an earthenware manufacturer. She was educated at a girls' boarding school called Laurel Bank, in Melrose. Between 1901 and 1904 she was the superintendent of a hall of residence for female students at Glasgow University, but, otherwise, she appears to have made her living throughout her life by writing. She was unmarried. As is made clear by the Prefaces of her books from time to time, she travelled extensively after 1904, including to Melbourne, California and China, although her obituary in The Times stated that she spent most of her life in Oxford and in London, where she died. H. E. Marshall is famous for her 1905 children's history of England, Our Island Story: A History of England for Boys and Girls, illustrated by A. S. Forrest. In the USA the book was entitled An Island Story. The book was a bestseller, was printed in numerous editions, and for fifty years was the standard and much-loved book by which children learned the history of England. However a lot of this book is historically inaccurate, much of it uses Shakespeare's plays for historical sources, like the section of Richard III is really a summary of the play.[citation needed] The book is still to be found in schools and homes, but the last printing was in 1953 and it went out of print in the 1960s. In 2005, an alliance of the Civitas think-tank and various national newspapers brought the book back into print, with the aim of sending a free copy to each of the UK's primary schools. Readers of The Daily Telegraph contributed �25,000 to the cost of the reprint.</p><h2>Tales of Sector General (The Galactic Gourmet, Final Diagnosis, Mind Changer)</h2><p>Includes the Galactic Gourmet, Final Diagnosis, and Mind Changer.</p><p></p><h2>A Force in the Earth: The Move of the Holy Spirit in World Evangelization</h2><p>Shows how the Holy Spirit is moving in world missions for the global advance of the gospel.

It also formed the basis of medieval magic. McGregor Mathers, Wynn Westcott, and other modern Qabalists made use of the Tree of Life, the curious diagram which is the key to the practical Qabalah as a system of illumination. This book deals with the work of the modern Qabalists as a contribution to the psychology of Mystical experience, and also throws much light on the nature of primitive religion and the Mystery Cults.</p><p>DION FORTUNE'S The Mystical Qabalah remains a classic in its clarity, linking the broad elements of Jewish traditional thought -- probably going back to the Babylonian Captivity and beyond -- with both Eastern and Western philosophy and later Christian insights. Dion Fortune was one of the first Adepts to bring this "secret tradition" to a wider audience. Some before her often only added to the overall mystery by elaborating on obscurity, but her account is simple, clear, and comprehensive.<p>The Qabalah could be described as a confidential Judaic explanation of the paradox of "the Many and the One" -- the complexity and diversity within a monotheistic unity. Whereas the Old Testament outlines the social and psychological development of a tightly knit "chosen group" culture, the supplementary Qabalah provides a detailed plan of the infrastructure behind the creative evolutionary process.</p><p>A major limitation of the Authorized English Version of the bible is the translation of the many Hebrew God-names by the single name, "God". The Mystical Qabalah devotes a chapter to each of the ten schematic "God-names", the qualities or "Sephiroth", which focus the principle archetypes behind evolving human activity: the Spiritual Source; the principles of Force and Form; Love and Justice; the Integrative principle or the Christ Force; Aesthetics and Logic; the dynamics of the Psyche; and finally, the Manifestation of life on Earth in a physical body.</p><p>The Mystical Qabalah works in a profoundly psychological way. Its lessons for the individual are invaluable and this book is a must for all who feel drawn to know themselves better so that their inner and outer worlds may be as one.</p><p>This revisededition includes an additional chapter of Fortune's original writing, an editorial update for contemporary readers, and a foldout with Tree of Life diagrams to facilitate study of the text.</p>Dion Fortune (1891?1946), founder of The Society of the Inner Light, was a prolific writer, pioneer psychologist, and powerful psychic. Author of the highly acclaimed Psychic Self-Defense, her novels include The Goat Foot God, The Demon Lover, The Winged Bull.</p><h2>Selling Water by the River: A Book about the Life Jesus Promised and the Religion That Gets in the Way</h2><p>Work, sex, ice cream, religion-they all promise fulfillment. But what they deliver is fleeting.<br><br>Jesus knew about this quest. He came to show us that peace is possible in this life, not just the next one. Yet Christianity, the very religion that claims Jesus as its own, has often built the biggest barriers to him and the life he promised. <br><br>Celebrated speaker and pastor Shane Hipps revives the faith with a fresh and persuasive understanding of the message of Jesus. The shocking truth is that Jesus proclaimed "eternal life" as a present reality that dwells within each of us. A transformative breakthrough, this book goes beyond "religion" or "spirituality" and cuts to the heart of our humanity and existence. It's about realizing that we already possess what we are searching for, and that the Heaven we long for isn't just a gift when we die, but a gift while we live.<br> <br></p><p><strong>Shane Hipps</strong> is the former lead teaching pastor at Mars Hill Bible Church in Grand Rapids, MI. Previously he served for five years as the lead pastor of a Mennonite church in Phoenix, AZ. He is a graduate of Fuller Seminary, the result of a self-termed "Damascus" experience.

In sum, this is one of the most instructive and pastoral books I have read in the last ten years and, Lord knows, one of the most needed."&#x2015;<b>Phyllis Tickle, Lecturer on Religion in America and Author of Emergence Christianity: What it Is, Where it is Going, and Why it Matters</b><br><br>"Shane Hipps brings us news that is too good not to be true: that what we thought we had to wait for, work for, strive for, reach for, fight for, die for, earn, learn, master, or attain is actually already a gift fully given in the present of this moment, graciously and freely ours if only we would awaken to it. This book not only offers us this good news with great clarity and delight; it also helps us-gently, wisely, simply, and profoundly-to be roused and raised into that blessed state of awe and awakening."&#x2015;<b>Brian D. McLaren, author of Why Did Jesus, Moses, the Buddha, and Mohammed Cross the Road? (www.brianmclaren.net)</b><br><br>"Masterfully weaving story, metaphor, and scripture into a tapestry, Shane Hipps puts his finger on something we all long for: a connection with the Divine. SELLING WATER BY THE RIVER will be a wonderful discovery for the many people who feel that true spirituality has been corrupted by culture and religion."&#x2015;<b>Tony Jones (tonyj.net) is a theologian and the author of many books, including&nbsp;The New Christians</b><br><br>"This book is one of the flare-ups from that religionless Christianity that more and more is breaking out in our world. Some of us will flee from what Shane Hipps tries to tell us in this book. Others will find what he has to say helpful in their efforts to live out the Jesus lifestyle in the landscape of a post-modern world. Whatever your reactions might be you will find the words on these pages cannot be ignored."&#x2015;<b>Tony Campolo, Eastern University</b><br><br>"Shane Hipps manages to take your beliefs and assumptions about God and the Bible and artfully, yet mercilessly wrings them out, leaving behind whatever drips to the floor, (the things that never belonged in there anyhow), then shakes them out and shows them to you again now free from what had clung to them -and before you is something beautiful, true, new and familiar."&#x2015;<b>Nadia Bolz-Weber, Founding Pastor, House for all Sinners and Saints</b><br><br>"Shane Hipps offers us a compelling and life-giving reminder that the work and life of Jesus is not identical to what we know to be Christianity. Without falling into cynicism or mere critique Shane invites us to encounter a wild ride with Jesus. The fruit of reconsidering the gospel in light of full humanity-his and our own-is like being given a refreshing IPA after a long dusty hike.

Brown is an Albert Whitman author.Grade 5-9 A lively and engrossing biography of the first woman to run for the U. S. Presidencyin 1884. Lockwood's life is developed chronologically, with a chapter each devoted to its major phases. There are several black-and-white illustrations: photographs, paintings, and copies of campaign literature. Brown concludes with an afterword on, among other things, her personal interest in Lockwood and an interesting and informative note on her research. The author has done a splendid job of bringing this almost-forgotten historical figure to life. The amount of detail provided and her vigorous writing style make the energy, persistence, and resilience of this fascinating woman leap right off the page. While almost completely avoiding fictionalizing and conjecture, she succeeds in making clear not only her subject's personality and achievements, but also the political and legal contexts in which she operated. For instance, Brown is able, in one paragraph, to explain the electoral college system. Americans will appreciate this glimpse into their own past; others will enjoy meeting an appealing character, an inspiring role model, and a major, if neglected, figure in the fields of law, human rights, international relations, aboriginal issues, politics, and education.

Compiled by Mayo Clinic experts in obstetrics, it offers a clear, thorough and reliable reference for this exciting and sometimes unpredictable journey. This comprehensive book includes:</p> <ul> <li>A month-by-month look at mom and baby</li> <li>In-depth "Decision Guides" to help you make informed decisions on topics such as how to select a health care provider, prenatal testing options, pain relief for childbirth, and many others</li> <li>An easy-to-use reference guide that covers topics such as morning sickness, heartburn, back pain, headaches and yeast infections, among others</li> <li>Information on pregnancy health concerns, including preterm labor, gestational diabetes and preeclampsia, along with an overview on being pregnant when you have pre-existing health conditions such as asthma, diabetes or hyperthyroidism</li> </ul></p><p><p>Mayo Clinic took root in farm fields near Rochester, Minn., in the late 1800s. It grew from the medical practice of a country doctor, William Worrall Mayo, and the partnership of his two sons, William J. and Charles H. Mayo &#x2013; affectionately known as Dr. Will and Dr. Charlie.</p><p>The brothers' innovative ideas and tireless work in learning and creating new surgical techniques attracted international attention. Physicians from around the world came to watch the Mayo brothers perform surgery.</p><p>The Mayo brothers invited other doctors to join them, forming teams of medical experts. Today, Mayo Clinic &#x2013; one of the world&#x2019;s oldest and largest multispecialty group practices &#x2013; comprises more than 45,000 physicians, scientists, nurses and other staff at its three locations in Rochester, Minn., Jacksonville, Fla., and Scottsdale, Ariz., and its regional community-based health care practices.</p>Would-be mothers looking for precise, accurate information from a reputable source will appreciate this mammoth pregnancy guide from the celebrated Mayo Clinic. The volume actually provides much more information than most parents will need: week by week accounts of the baby&#x2019;s development, entries on how pregnancy can be affected by dozens of previous health conditions (such as HIV and diabetes), self-care tips for side effects like nausea and back pain, sidebars that explain the difference between identical and fraternal twins, etc. But the book contains at least one feature that most pregnant women will find indispensable: charts that indicate how to handle "troublesome signs and symptoms" during each three week period. For example, if a woman has slight spotting during the first four weeks of pregnancy, the chart tells her to notify a doctor during her next hospital visit. But if she has any bleeding at all during weeks 29 to 32, the chart indicates that she should tell her doctor immediately. Another stellar feature is the book&#x2019;s even-handed series of "decision guides," which help parents make those hard (and even guilt-inducing) choices about breastfeeding, circumcision and whether or not to go back to work. Some parents may find the book&#x2019;s cool, no-nonsense tone intimidating, or even scary, but when deciding what to do about mid-term cramps or pain, most readers will find great reassurance this volume&#x2019;s carefully vetted facts. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He has written over 100 books for adults and young readers. He divides his time among Alaska, New Mexico, Minnesota, and the Pacific.An autobiographical book that gives through spare but vivid language a look at a man who thought, because he was a hunter and a trapper, that he knew about the outdoors. Instead, he discovered he knew very little until he opened himself to the realities of predators and prey, and to the lessons taught to him by the animals he encountered and the sled dogs he trained and raced. This is not a life story, with dates and names and achievements, but rather Paulsen's reflections on the peculiarities and surprises of nature. Some of the lessons are violent and painful, brought on by the natural instincts of wild animals or Paulsen's own mistakes; others are touching or humorous, and convey a sharp sense of observation and awareness of the various personality traits of the dogs he has raised and run. And some are unexplainable--mysteries of nature that would seem incredible if written in a work of fiction. The anecdotal style and rhythmic, sometimes abrupt sentence structure demand close attention, and the switch in the last third of the book to Paulsen's day-by-day account of the Iditarod is sudden, though expected. The Iditarod story is intensely personal, focusing on Paulsen's thoughts, actions, and hallucinations during those 17 days rather than presenting a comprehensive view of the race and the competitors. Both segments of the book generate wonder at the abilities of animals and should introduce fans of Paulsen's fiction to a different type of writing. --Susan Schuller, Milwaukee Public Library<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Love Hina, Volume 13</h2><p>Follows the romantic adventures of Keitaro Urashima after his plans for the future are derailed when he fails to pass the Tokyo University entrance exam and he becomes the reluctant landlord of the all-girl Hinata House.</p><p></p><h2>The Night Strangers: A Novel</h2><p>In a dusty corner of a basement in a rambling Victorian house in northern New Hampshire, a door has long been sealed shut with 39 six-inch-long carriage bolts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The home's new owners are Chip and Emily Linton and their twin ten-year-old daughters.&nbsp;Together they hope to rebuild their lives there after Chip, an airline pilot, has to ditch his 70-seat regional jet in Lake Champlain due to double engine failure.

The difference this time? Some of those characters are dead.</p><p><strong>Guest Reviewer: Justin Cronin on <em>The Night Strangers</em> by Chris Bohjalian</strong> <p> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <em><strong>Justin Cronin</strong> is the bestselling author of </em>The Passage<em>, as well as </em>Mary and O'Neil<em>, which won the Pen/Hemingway Award and the Stephen Crane Prize, and </em>The Summer Guest.<p></p> <p>To put the matter succinctly: The first chapter of Chris Bohjalian&#x2019;s <em>The Night Strangers</em> is so riveting, I dropped the book in the tub.</p> <p>I spent the next half-hour running a hair-dryer over its soaked pages. By the time the task was complete the book was as swollen as a Reuben sandwich. It was clear to me that if the first twenty pages were any indication, I&#x2019;d better read the rest somewhere safe and secure, with neither water nor fire, and while I was at it, some good soundproofing, lest I freak out my children by shrieking like an acrophobe on a roller coaster.</p> <p>I wasn&#x2019;t wrong.</p> <p>Describing Bohjalian&#x2019;s thirteenth novel isn&#x2019;t a simple matter. Its dovetailing plots are so seamlessly interwoven--as tightly screwed together as the thirty-nine carriage bolts sealing the mysterious door in the Linton&#x2019;s (very creepy) basement--I don&#x2019;t want to give too much away.</p> <p>But it&#x2019;s also a challenge to summarize because <em>The Night Strangers</em> is so many novels at once, as all good novels must be. It&#x2019;s a psychological thriller. It&#x2019;s a domestic drama, the story of a family coping with the aftermath of dislocation and disaster. It&#x2019;s a book about a specifically American locale, in this case a small town in a remote corner of New Hampshire. It&#x2019;s a classic New England ghost story, and a hell of a good one. (It also won&#x2019;t make you want to get on an airplane anytime soon, though there I go, telling too much.)</p> <p>I&#x2019;ve been following Bohjalian for some time. Always I&#x2019;ve come away from his novels replete with admiration--and not a little envy--for his skill and versatility, book after book. His psychological acumen is downright Flaubert-esque, most notably (and remarkably) in his creation of female characters. But Bohjalian is a reader-friendly writer, too. His novels are compulsively discussable, the kinds of tales that employ specific human dramas to probe larger ethical issues. They make you think. They are, in every sense, &#x201c;what would you do?&#x201d; books, and the answers are never simple.</p> <p>If there&#x2019;s a core to Bohjalian&#x2019;s work, though, it&#x2019;s the cultural divide between the modern scientific world and--for lack of a better term--the spiritual world and its ancient practices. His novels are populated by the likes of dowsers (<em>Water Witches</em>), the practitioners of traditional female-assisted birth (<em>Midwives</em>), homeopaths (<em>The Law of Similars</em>), even a shape-shifter (<em>Trans-Sister Radio</em>).</p> <p><em>The Night Strangers</em> follows this tradition, but with a dark twist. The witches of Bethel, New Hampshire are decidedly of the sinister variety&#x2014;albeit more likely to sell real estate and wear stylish leather skirts than fly around on brooms and don pointy hats. Beneath the town&#x2019;s charming rural surface of gingerbread Victorians, maple sugarhouses, and fiery foliage lurks a conspiracy of evil reminiscent of Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x2019;s &#x201c;Young Goodman Brown.&#x201d; How evil? Suffice it to say that when somebody drops by to welcome newcomers to the neighborhood with a plate of vegan brownies, they should think twice before taking the first bite.</p> <p>But to say anything more would be to reveal too much. Fans of his fiction, as I am, will know <em>The Night Strangers</em> is pure Bohjalian. Newcomers will come away wanting more. And if you read it in the bathtub, consider yourself warned.</p> <p></p><br>CHRIS BOHJALIAN is the critically acclaimed author of fourteen books, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>The Double Bind,</i> <i>Secrets of Eden,</i> and <i>Skeletons at the Feast.</i> His novel, <i>Midwives</i>, was a number one <i>New York Times</i> bestseller and a selection of Oprah's Book Club.

Across town, the well-to-do Chalfonte siblings are preparing for the upcoming wedding of brother Curtis. But for youngest sister Celeste, the celebration brings about a change she never expected and a lesson about love she&#x2019;ll not soon forget.<br> &nbsp;<br> Set against the backdrop of America emerging from World War I, <i>Cakewalk </i>is an outrageous and affecting novel about a small town where ideas of sin and virtue, love and sex, men and women, politics and religion, can be as divided as the Mason-Dixon Line that runs right through it&#x2014;and where there&#x2019;s no problem that can&#x2019;t be cured by a good yarn and an even better scotch.

Julia, called Juts, ran to catch up with her as she flew from the store.<br><br>&#x201c;Wheezie, hey!&#x201d;<br><br>Slowing down a bit, the slender Louise called over her shoulder, &#x201c;Come on, we&#x2019;ll miss the first few minutes.&#x201d;<br><br>The two trotted, slipping a bit, reaching the theater. A line, not long but long enough, curved down Frederick Road.<br><br>&#x201c;Good. They won&#x2019;t start the movie with people still outside.&#x201d; A puff of frosty breath escaped Louise&#x2019;s lips, artfully enhanced with a light shade of lipstick.<br><br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t Orrie going to meet you?&#x201d; Juts named Louise&#x2019;s best friend.<br><br>&#x201c;You know Orrie, she slides in at the last minute.&#x201d; Louise peered up the line, then whispered, &#x201c;Get a load of Lottie Rhodes.&#x201d;<br><br>Juts stepped a bit out of the line to look at the attractive young woman: too much lipstick, too much of everything.<br><br>When the line started moving, Juts then said, voice low, &#x201c;She&#x2019;s got the same coat you do, only yours looks better on you.&#x201d;<br><br>The two fought night and day but were best friends when they weren&#x2019;t fighting. Louise smiled. &#x201c;You know how she is in summer. At least she&#x2019;s covered up in the snow.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How do you know? You can&#x2019;t see the front of her and she loves to show it off. Maybe she has snow in her cleavage. And you know who is just as bad? Dimps. She pushes her bosoms on the boys at school, then pretends she has to squeeze by them. Ugh.&#x201d;<br><br>Delilah Rhodes Jr., called Dimps Jr., as her mother is Big Dimps, obviously had studied her sister Lottie&#x2019;s ploys for male attention. Both of the Rhodes girls, drilled by their mother, teased but drew the line. Big Dimps ran the cosmetics counter at the Bon Ton. She made certain her girls, cosmetics artfully applied, looked alluring. Given a lackluster marriage, Big Dimps&#x2019;s view of same had narrowed to a man&#x2019;s financial capacity or potential for the future. The purpose of this bosom barrage was to ensnare the richest young man possible. As Big Dimps felt she had married beneath her, she was determined her two daughters wouldn&#x2019;t make the same mistake. Surely they would make other ones.<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t see Lottie&#x2019;s date,&#x201d; Louise grumbled.<br><br>&#x201c;Me neither. He&#x2019;s at the window, I think.&#x201d;<br><br>Paul Trumbull, new to Runnymede, an army veteran from the Great War, purchased two tickets. He&#x2019;d been seeing Lottie over the fall, a desultory courtship discouraged by Big Dimps because he was a lowly housepainter. As a small rebellion against her mother, this made him somewhat more attractive to Lottie. Also, Paul was quite handsome. Sooner or later Lottie would cave to her mercenary matrimonial purpose, but for now, why not string along as many young men as possible?<br><br>Southerners referred to such fellows as conquests. Lottie hoped to be spoken of as a woman of many conquests, a trail of broken hearts left behind her.<br><br>Juts took the ticket her sister had bought for her once they&#x2019;d reached the ticket booth. &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When you get a job, you can take me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Soon,&#x201d; Juts promised.<br><br>&#x201c;You have two more years of school.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m bored. I&#x2019;ll finish tenth grade. That&#x2019;s enough.&#x201d;<br><br>The two greatly resembled one another. Louise had attended Immaculata Academy, paid for by Celeste Chalfonte, their mother&#x2019;s employer, since Louise evidenced musical ability. Louise had converted to Catholicism. Juts, on the other hand, attended South Runnymede High School. She dutifully went to the Lutheran church and didn&#x2019;t believe a word of it.<br><br>They walked down the right aisle of the clean movie house, finding three seats near the front.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go in first. You can save a seat for Orrie,&#x201d; Juts suggested.<br><br>Louise sat down, did not yet take off her coat.<br><br>Still in her coat a few rows behind them, Lottie also sat holding a seat for Paul, who was buying popcorn.<br><br>Just as Paul entered the aisle the lights flickered, the house went dark, the organist began to play. The film title appeared, Keith Morgan, the organist, hit a few notes, and a rustle of anticipation filled the theater.<br><br>Squinting, popcorn in hand, Paul walked by Lottie, who had turned to talk to one of her girlfriends down the row. The theater, filled with young people, grew quiet.<br><br>He came upon the empty seat, noticed the coat, sat down before Louise could protest, put the popcorn box toward her, then kissed her.<br><br>Louise hauled off and slapped him. &#x201c;How dare you! You beast!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, don&#x2019;t you touch my sister.&#x201d; Juts leaned over Louise.<br><br>Stunned, Paul couldn&#x2019;t find his voice but the usher found him.<br><br>Tall Walter Rendell yanked Paul out of his seat. &#x201c;Come on, bub.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t do anything. I mean, I thought she was someone else.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what they all say.&#x201d; Walter dragged Paul up the aisle, popcorn falling from the red-�and-�white box Paul grasped.<br><br>Having seen the kiss, Lottie shrieked, &#x201c;You two-�timer. I never want to see you again.&#x201d; She stood up and smacked him with her purse.<br><br>&#x201c;Lottie?&#x201d;<br><br>She smacked him again.<br><br>Seeing a furious Lottie, Louise&#x2019;s mood improved considerably.<br><br>Walter continued to drag an increasingly resistant Paul.<br><br>Proclaiming for all to hear, Louise enunciated quite clearly, &#x201c;Lottie, if you can&#x2019;t keep your boyfriend happy, it&#x2019;s not my fault.&#x201d;<br><br>Juts laughed out loud, as did others.<br><br>Orrie finally arrived in the theater. Baffled as to the uproar, Orrie sidestepped the two men just as Paul hauled off and belted the usher.<br><br>&#x201c;Goddammit, I didn&#x2019;t come home from the war to put up with this!&#x201d;<br><br>Walter struck back, hitting the smaller but wiry man in the chest. Ever happy to help a brother veteran, other young men jumped Walter. Walter&#x2019;s friends jumped the vets.<br><br>Louise, Juts, and Orrie turned, sitting on the backs of the seats in front of them, as most other people did, to enjoy this show.<br><br>Inflamed by the insult, Lottie stomped away, her largesse bouncing with each determined stride, pocketbook in hand. She swung it at Louise, who ducked.<br><br>&#x201c;You hussy. Kissing my date.&#x201d;<br><br>Louise ducked another swing. &#x201c;Lottie, he kissed me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If he&#x2019;d known he was kissing Runnymede&#x2019;s religious nut, he would have gagged.&#x201d;<br><br>Louise cocked her fist, landing a good punch right on Lottie&#x2019;s left glory.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll throttle you.&#x201d; Lottie dropped her pocketbook, reaching to choke Louise.<br><br>Juts blocked Lottie&#x2019;s hands. &#x201c;You touch my sister and I&#x2019;ll tear one of those zeppelins right off your body.&#x201d;<br><br>Orrie added to the defense, but Lottie&#x2019;s friends in the theater came to her aid.<br><br>Yashew Gregorivitch was a big shambling classmate of Louise&#x2019;s. He&#x2019;d left school to join the navy. He was stuck down front, fighting to get up to his friends, who were all fighting to help Paul. He threw his popcorn box over his shoulder.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll get popcorn in my organ!&#x201d; yelled Keith.<br><br>Yashew began to part people in the aisle like Moses did the Red Sea. &#x201c;For Christ&#x2019;s sake, the only organ you need to worry about is between your legs.&#x201d; Whistles blew, but that stopped no one. The house lights went up, all the better to see who you were punching. Harper Wheeler, a young cop on the beat for South Runnymede, pushed into the fray. Outnumbered, he yelled for the ticket taker to call for reinforcements. And he asked the fellow also to call the North Runnymede police department.<br><br>Within fifteen minutes, police from both sides of the Mason-�Dixon Line filled the theater, hauling out pugilists, one by one. The paddywagons filled up with men.<br><br>A confused Harper asked the police chief, now on the scene, &#x201c;What do we do with the women?&#x201d;<br><br>Chief Archibald Cadwalder, a handsome man now in his mid-�sixties, grinned and answered, &#x201c;Get the hell out of their way.&#x201d;<br><br>As the two paddywagons drove off in their separate directions, the girls finally wore themselves out. They tore posters off the wall, emptied out the popcorn machine, but other than that, most of the damage they did was to one another.<br><br>Al Dexter, the theater owner, also called by ticket taker Robbie Anson, flicked the lights then pushed the females out of the theater. He locked the doors, leaning against them.<br><br>&#x201c;My God, Robbie, what in the hell happened?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t rightly know. I heard Louise Hunsenmeir holler and then all hell broke loose.&#x201d;<br><br>Al surveyed the damage. &#x201c;Could have been worse. Tell you what, Robbie, let me call my wife so she doesn&#x2019;t have a cow since I&#x2019;ll miss dinner. Then you and I and Walter can clean this up.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Archie took Walter in the paddywagon, boss.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah.&#x201d; He thought some more. &#x201c;Well, let me call her. We can at least sweep up the popcorn.&#x201d;<br><br>Leaving open the door, he walked into his small office. The upright phone squatted on his desk. He dialed knowing full well that telephone operator Martha Shortride was listening in.<br><br>&#x201c;Honey pie, I&#x2019;ll miss supper&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>Minta Mae interrupted him. &#x201c;Why? You know the Creightons are coming.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s been a, well, a riot among my customers. I&#x2019;ve got a lot of cleaning up to do.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A what? A what? Alvin, if any one of those rioting miscreants is a Sister of Gettysburg, you tell me, you tell me right now and I will eighty-�six her, oh yes, I will.&#x201d;<br><br>Minta Mae Dexter presided over the Sisters of Gettysburg, which she considered the pinnacle of acceptance for anyone living in North Runnymede. The Daughters of the Confederacy, South Side, obviously thought differently.<br><br>&#x201c;Honey, these were young people.&#x201d; The minute this escaped Al&#x2019;s mouth he was sorry, adding quickly, &#x201c;Most of your troops, sugar, lack your youthful good looks.&#x201d;<br><br>Smiling, she replied sweetly, &#x201c;Were there any Daughters there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If there were, I would have had to call an ambulance. Those poor girls need canes now and they can barely see to swat anyone.&#x201d;<br><br>That satisfied Minta Mae. &#x201c;Well, you just get here when you can, darling. If you&#x2019;re late, I&#x2019;ll keep Katie and she can warm up the food, but of course, you know Fannie Jump Creighton will want to know everything, so I hope you make it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do my very best.&#x201d;<br><br>He would, too, because when Minta Mae called him &#x201c;darling,&#x201d; a nighttime reward came his way. Al often wondered if other husbands were kept on thin sexual rations. They never discussed it.<br><br>Louise, Juts, and Orrie walked along the south corner of the square along with other ladies, to await the Emmitsburg Pike trolley. Lottie and her crew headed toward Baltimore Street to tend to one another&#x2019;s wounds at Lottie&#x2019;s house, a lovely white-�painted-�brick affair built in the mid&#x2013;�eighteen hundreds.<br><br>Juts, the youngest of the group, laughed. &#x201c;We look like something the cat drug in.&#x201d;<br><br>Louise raised her voice. &#x201c;I tore Lottie&#x2019;s shirt. I nearly exposed her breasts then stopped myself. She&#x2019;d enjoy it too much. You know, she would cry out, run out into the lobby, and let all the men see both of her assets. I hate her. I truly hate her.&#x201d;<br><br>Boots Frothingham, a class ahead of Juts at South Runnymede High, chimed in. &#x201c;We all do, Louise, and her sister is even worse.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t get any worse.&#x201d; The temperature had dropped into the twenties. Louise hoped the trolley would soon arrive.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yes, Dimps Jr. is worse. She rouges her nipples,&#x201d; Boots declared, and this was seconded by others in the group.<br><br>Louise was aghast. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She does. In gym class when we shower, she turns her back, towels off, then goes to the mirror and dabs on a little rouge.&#x201d; Boots blinked with disgust.<br><br>&#x201c;Whatever for? Who is going to see them?&#x201d; Dumbfounded, Louise was curious.<br><br>&#x201c;When it&#x2019;s warm, she wears a brassiere and a thin blouse. You can see, and you know what else she does? Oh, this is even worse.&#x201d; Boots took a deep breath as everyone leaned forward toward her. &#x201c;She will pick up a cold pop bottle and hold it next to her breast so her, you know, stands out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She freezes her nipples!&#x201d; twelfth grader Anselma Constantino shouted.<br><br>&#x201c;Why do boys pay attention to all this?&#x201d; Juts wondered. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t care.&#x201d; Juts considered the difficulties of protuberances. &#x201c;Why would anyone want to get smacked in the face with a big breast? They get in the way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d have to ask the boys,&#x201d; Boots sensibly said.<br><br>Anselma airily answered this. &#x201c;My brother says it gets them hard. Just thinking about breasts does it, so anyone pushing them onto a boy can usually get what she wants.&#x201d;<br><br>Boots shook her head. &#x201c;Anselma, that&#x2019;s horrid.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe, but that&#x2019;s what he said. But he added, much as they like it, they would never marry a girl like that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, well, that&#x2019;s a big relief,&#x201d; Juts sarcastically said as the trolley at last pulled up to the corner.<br><br>Chapter Two<br><br>February 1, 1920<br><br>Sunday<br><br>Winter, long and cold this year, offered no relief. The light snow of yesterday became heavier. The trolleys still ran but people didn&#x2019;t linger after church in the morning. Everyone knew how easy it was to get stranded. You couldn&#x2019;t trust the automobiles either. Even with chains on the tires, a machine could get stuck in a snowdrift.<br><br>There were more and more automobiles in Runnymede. Trucks hauled tools and heavy supplies. Once businessmen figured out the cost of maintaining a truck, many switched because in some ways the machines proved easier to repair than horses. Even throwing a shoe could cost half a day&#x2019;s work, because you had to get the animal to the blacksmith, and hope there wasn&#x2019;t a backup and that he hadn&#x2019;t quicked the hoof, which would keep the animal off hard work for some days. However, many folks still swore by their draft horses or their harness horses because they sure were reliable in snow and muck and they loved them to boot. It was harder to love a truck.<br><br>Louise and Juts lived at the top of Emmitsburg Pike on a small farm called Bumblebee Hill. The trolley line on Emmitsburg stopped at the bottom of the hill, which made for a strenuous walk down, but with a setting this beautiful, the journey was well worth it.<br><br>The young ladies&#x2019; mother, Cora Hunsenmeir, fed small, precisely cut logs into the wood-�burning stove and checked a pork roast, the glorious aroma of which filled the small wooden home, much to the delight of the dog and cat.<br><br>A chug, chug, chug drew Juts to the window.<br><br>&#x201c;Momma, there&#x2019;s a truck outside,&#x201d; she exclaimed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s one of Douglas Anson&#x2019;s paint trucks.&#x201d;<br><br>Cora wiped her hands on a dish towel, straightened her apron, hurried to the door, and opened it after a few knocks.<br><br>&#x201c;Mrs. Hunsenmeir?&#x201d; Cuts on his face, flowers in one hand and a small box in the other, Paul Trumbull raised his hat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve come to apologize.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, sweetie, no need to apologize in the cold.

McSorley said to Comiskey.<br> Comiskey gave him a quivering smile.&nbsp; "Aye, no worries."<br> Two cops got out of the car, donning hats and bright reflective jackets.&nbsp; The woman wasn't bad looking, light brown hair swept up under her cap.&nbsp; The man was tall and in good shape.&nbsp; His deep tan looked alien beneath the grey sky.&nbsp; They approached the Focus, the man leading.<br> The wipers scraped across the windscreen, the rubber-on-glass creak in counterpoint to McSorley's heartbeat.&nbsp; He put his finger on the button, ready to lower the window when the cop asked.&nbsp; Instead, the cop grabbed the handle and opened the door.&nbsp; Rain leaked in.&nbsp; It had been raining for nearly three months solid.&nbsp; All day, every day, no let-up.&nbsp; McSorley blinked as a heavy drop splashed on his cheek.<br> "Afternoon," the cop said.&nbsp; He had an English accent, hard and clipped.&nbsp; "Shut your engine off, please, sir."<br> McSorley turned the key.&nbsp; The engine died, freezing the wipers in mid sweep.<br> "Just keep your hands where I can see them, there's a good chap," the cop said.<br> That accent, McSorley thought.&nbsp; Officer class.&nbsp; It spoke of parade grounds and stiff salutes, not traffic patrols and police checkpoints.<br> The cop ducked his head down.&nbsp; "You too, gentlemen."<br> Comiskey put his hands on the dashboard; Hughes placed his on the back of the passenger seat.&nbsp; McSorley gripped the steering wheel and studied the cop's face.&nbsp; His skin was a deep brown, not the shallow tan of a week at the beach.&nbsp; His lips were slick from balm applied to the cracks, as if they'd been baked in some arid place.&nbsp; A vision of this cop crawling across a desert flashed in McSorley's mind.&nbsp; The image terrified him, and he couldn't think why.<br> The cop's hands stayed out of view until he reached in and took the key from the ignition.&nbsp; A black leather glove, expensive looking.<br> "What do you want?" McSorley asked.&nbsp; His voice bubbled in his throat.<br> The cop straightened and looked back down the road.&nbsp; "You're not wearing your seatbelt.&nbsp; Any reason?"<br> "I forgot," McSorley said.&nbsp; He looked to the rear-view mirror, knowing what he'd see.&nbsp; The van pulled out of the junction, turning towards them.<br> The woman cop walked to the passenger side.&nbsp; She leaned down and peered in, first at Comiskey, then at Hughes.&nbsp; Comiskey gave her a weak smile.&nbsp; She did not return it.<br> "Well, that won't do," the tanned cop said.&nbsp; "You don't want points on your licence, do you?"<br> The van filled the rear-view mirror.&nbsp; The woman cop waved, and it pulled alongside the Focus.&nbsp; The tanned cop reached in and hit the button to open the boot.&nbsp; It would have sprung up a good six inches when the car was new, but now it just loosened itself from the seal.&nbsp; The woman cop went to the back of the Focus, and the boot lid whined as she opened it fully.&nbsp; Cold, damp air kissed the back of McSorley's neck.&nbsp; The smell of manure from the fields around them mixed with the bitter sting of his own sweat.<br> The two men stayed in the van's cabin, but McSorley heard heavy feet moving inside, and then its rear doors opening.&nbsp; He went to crane his head around, but the tanned cop hunkered down beside him, smiling.<br> McSorley studied the peeler's face and all at once knew every tale the lines and cracks told.&nbsp; He had been in a dry and barren place, crawling in the dirt, hunting his prey.&nbsp; Iraq, maybe Afghanistan.&nbsp; Maybe somewhere the Yanks and the Brits would never admit to.&nbsp; And now he was here, not far from the Irish border, his sun-scorched face blank and unyielding.&nbsp; Just another job.<br> "You're not a peeler," McSorley said.<br> The cop's hard smile didn't even flicker.&nbsp; "Where are you headed today, sir?"<br> "I said, you're no peeler.&nbsp; What do you want?"<br> Footsteps scuffled somewhere behind the two vehicles.&nbsp; Something screeched and groaned as it was dragged along the floor of the van.&nbsp; Voices issued orders, hissed and strained.&nbsp; The cop's eyes never left McSorley's.<br> A voice said, "On three. One, two, three--hup!"<br> The Focus lurched and leaned back on its rear axle as something monstrously heavy was dumped in the boot.<br> "What the fuck was that?" Comiskey asked.<br> Hughes turned in the seat, but the parcel shelf blocked his vision.&nbsp; McSorley watched shifts in the light in his rear-view mirror.&nbsp; He wanted to weep, but smothered the urge.&nbsp; He heard more scuffling, then the thudding of feet clambering back into the van.&nbsp; The car's boot lid slammed home, and McSorley saw the woman cop through the back window, along with a heavyset man.&nbsp; The parcel shelf didn't quite find home, something pushing it up from beneath.<br> The woman cop carried a long sports bag.&nbsp; The heavyset man raised an automatic rifle.&nbsp; It looked like the Heckler &amp; Koch G3 McSorley had fired behind a Newry pub years before.&nbsp; The man approached from the driver's side, keeping the rifle on McSorley.<br> McSorley felt the heat of tears rising behind his eyes.&nbsp; Fuck if he'd cry.&nbsp; He swallowed them.&nbsp; The rear passenger side door opened.&nbsp; He looked back over his shoulder.<br> The woman cop reached in and dropped something metallic.&nbsp; Its weight thudded on the carpet between Hughes's feet.<br> "Oh, fuck," Hughes said.&nbsp; He scuttled sideways, behind McSorley, away from whatever lay there.<br> She tossed something else in.&nbsp; It clanked against the first object.<br> "Oh, Jesus," Hughes said, his voice rising into a breathy whine.<br> The woman drew a pair of long cylinders from the bag.&nbsp; McSorley stared at them for a moment, his brain struggling to catch up with what he saw, before he recognised the twin barrels of a shotgun.&nbsp; She placed it butt-first into the foot well, letting the long barrels fall across Hughes's thigh.<br> "Fuck me, they're guns," Hughes said as the door swung shut.&nbsp; "What's going on, Eugene?"<br> McSorley looked back to the tanned cop.&nbsp; The cop smiled, winked, and closed the driver's door.&nbsp; He held up the car key, showed it to McSorley, and thumbed it twice.&nbsp; The locks whirred and clunked.&nbsp; The cop placed the key on the bonnet, just beneath the glass.<br> "Christ," McSorley said.<br> "What are they doing, Eugene?" Comiskey asked.<br> "Oh, Sweet Jesus."&nbsp; McSorley crossed himself.&nbsp; His bladder screamed for release.&nbsp; He fought it.<br> The two cops, who McSorley knew were not cops at all, got back into the Skoda and pulled away.&nbsp; The van eased in front of the Focus.&nbsp; The man with the rifle grinned at McSorley.&nbsp; He kept the gun trained on him as he climbed into the open back.<br> Comiskey tried the handle.&nbsp; "Open the locks," he said.<br> "Can't," McSorley said.&nbsp; Tears warmed his cheeks.&nbsp; "The bastard double-locked it.&nbsp; You need the key to open it."<br> The van moved off, picking up speed.&nbsp; The man with the rifle waved.&nbsp; McSorley's bladder gave out.<br> "Oh, God," McSorley said.&nbsp; "Jesus, boys."<br> Comiskey slammed the window with his elbow.&nbsp; He tried it again.&nbsp; Hughes lifted the shotgun and rammed the butt against the rear window.<br> McSorley knew it was pointless.&nbsp; "Oh, Christ, boys."<br> Hughes hit the window once more, and it shattered.&nbsp; He lurched to the opening.&nbsp; Comiskey scrambled to climb back and follow.<br> Waves of rainwater smeared the windscreen as the van grew smaller in the distance.&nbsp; Hughes roared as he forced his shoulders through the gap.<br> "Jesus," McSorley whispered.&nbsp; "Jesus, boys, they killed us."<br> He barely registered the detonator's POP! before God's fist slammed him into nothing.</p><h2>My Little French Kitchen: Over 100 recipes from the mountains, market squares and shores of France</h2><p>Rachel Khoo follows The Little Paris Kitchen with The Little French Kitchen, bringing her modern twists to classic recipes from around the country.Rachel Khoo became an overnight sensation when her first book The Little Paris Kitchen and BBC2 television series launched last year.

My birth certificate lists my name as Calliope Helen Stephanides. My most recent driver&#39;s license records my first name simply as Cal.&#39; So begins the breathtaking story of Calliope Stephanides, and three generations of the Greek-American Stephanides family who travel from a tiny village overlooking Mount Olympus in Asia Minor to Prohibition era Detroit, witnessing its glory days as the Motor City, and the race riots of l967, before they move out to the tree-lined streets of suburban Grosse Point, Michigan. To understand why Calliope is not like other girls, she has to uncover a guilty family secret, and the astonishing genetic history that turns Callie into Cal, one of the most audacious and wondrous narrators in contemporary fiction. Lyrical and thrilling, &#34;Middlesex&#34; is an exhilarating reinvention of the American epic.</p><p>"I was born twice: first, as a baby girl, on a remarkably smogless Detroit day in January of 1960; and then again, as a teenage boy, in an emergency room near Petoskey, Michigan, in August of 1974." And so begins <i>Middlesex</i>, the mesmerizing saga of a near-mythic Greek American family and the "roller-coaster ride of a single gene through time." The odd but utterly believable story of Cal Stephanides, and how this 41-year-old hermaphrodite was raised as Calliope, is at the tender heart of this long-awaited second novel from Jeffrey Eugenides, whose elegant and haunting 1993 debut, <i>The Virgin Suicides</i>, remains one of the finest first novels of recent memory.<p> Eugenides weaves together a kaleidoscopic narrative spanning 80 years of a stained family history, from a fateful incestuous union in a small town in early 1920s Asia Minor to Prohibition-era Detroit; from the early days of Ford Motors to the heated 1967 race riots; from the tony suburbs of Grosse Pointe and a confusing, aching adolescent love story to modern-day Berlin. Eugenides's command of the narrative is astonishing. He balances Cal/Callie's shifting voices convincingly, spinning this strange and often unsettling story with intelligence, insight, and generous amounts of humor:</p><p> </p><blockquote>Emotions, in my experience aren't covered by single words. I don't believe in "sadness," "joy," or "regret." ... I'd like to have at my disposal complicated hybrid emotions, Germanic traincar constructions like, say, "the happiness that attends disaster." Or: "the disappointment of sleeping with one's fantasy." ... I'd like to have a word for "the sadness inspired by failing restaurants" as well as for "the excitement of getting a room with a minibar." I've never had the right words to describe my life, and now that I've entered my story, I need them more than ever.</blockquote><p> When you get to the end of this splendorous book, when you suddenly realize that after hundreds of pages you have only a few more left to turn over, you'll experience a quick pang of regret knowing that your time with Cal is coming to a close, and you may even resist finishing it--putting it aside for an hour or two, or maybe overnight--just so that this wondrous, magical novel might never end. <i>--Brad Thomas Parsons</i></p>&#x201c;Funny, sad, tragic, and beautifully rendered.&#x201d; -- <i>The Ottawa Citizen</i> <b><br></b> <br>&#x201c;A tenderly rendered and often hilariously bizarre saga.&#x201d; -- <i>The Edmonton Journal</i> <b><br></b> <br>&#x201c;This novel is longer, more populated, sadder, funnier, bigger in every way than its predecessor.

His father, Hamilcar, was also a great strategist and master tactician who imposed Carthaginian rule over much of present-day Spain. After Hamilcar led the Carthaginian forces against Rome in the First Punic War, Hannibal followed in his father&#x2019;s footsteps, leading Carthage in the Second Punic War.<br> <br>From the time he was a teenager, Hannibal fought against Rome. He is famed for leading Carthage&#x2019;s army across north Africa, into Spain, along the Mediterranean coast, and then crossing the Alps with his army and war elephants. Hannibal won victories in northern Italy by outmaneuvering his Roman adversaries and defeated a larger Roman army at the battle of Cannae in 216 BC. Unable to force Rome to capitulate, he was eventually forced to leave Italy and return to Carthage when a savvy Roman general named Scipio invaded north Africa. Hannibal and Scipio fought an epic battle at Zama, which Hannibal lost. The terms of surrender were harsh and many Carthaginians blamed Hannibal, eventually forcing him into exile until his death.<br> <br>To this day Hannibal is still regarded as a military genius. Napoleon, George Patton, and Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr. are only some of the generals who studied and admired him. His strategy and tactics are still taught in military academies. He is one of the figures of the ancient world whose life and exploits never fail to impress. Historian Patrick N. Hunt has led archeological expeditions in the Alps and elsewhere to study Hannibal&#x2019;s achievements. Now he brings Hannibal&#x2019;s incredible story to life in this riveting and dramatic book.</p><p>Patrick N. Hunt is an archeologist, historian, and biographer who has taught humanities, archeology, and mythology at Stanford University since 1993. A Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in London, Hunt has been featured on TV documentaries, including&nbsp;<i>National Geographic Explorer</i>,&nbsp;<i>Nova</i>, and the Discovery Channel. He is also a National Geographic Expeditions expert.

He lives in the Bay Area, California.Hannibal Fifteen<p></p> CANNAE<p></p> <br>Cannae still elicits a shudder from almost everyone after more than two thousand years. A considerable part of Hannibal&#x2019;s reputation as a military genius seems to rest on this half day in early August of 216 BCE, perhaps more than is justifiable.<br> <br>Reconstructing the battle from sometimes confusing or even slightly contradictory sources is challenging, but enough consensus exists to provide a fairly reliable account. Even after winnowing out the hyperbole that accompanies such events, Cannae remains a singularly dramatic day. Standing on the hill above the valley where the Aufidus (now Ofanto) River winds to the coast, and walking back and forth on the narrow plain that is about a mile or so wide on an August day similar to that in the summer of 216, I was reminded that however peaceful and still it looked, the horrible fate of so many Romans in that battle had made Cannae infamous.</p><h2>Benchmark Series: Microsoft (R) Excel 2016 Levels 1 and 2: Text</h2><p>With Paradigm&#39;s Benchmark Series: Microsoft Excel 2016 Levels 1 and 2, students build mastery skills in Excel 2016.

The Music Pack is filled with paper instruments, including piano and complete orchestra, 3-D models, and a 75-minute CD featuring 20 masterpieces of Western music from the recording archives of EMI Classics. (Performing Arts)</p><p>Nothing spurs sequels like success, and the unexpected hit two years ago of Knopf's The Art Pack, which sold nearly 150,000 copies, rendered another such book inevitable. This one, put together by the same English paper engineer and designer, working with composer and broadcaster Berkeley, is an attempt to do for music what its predecessor did for the visual arts. The real problem, of course, is that music is not visual, and though a great deal of ingenuity has gone into creating pop-up and movable instruments, scales, time signatures, piano interiors, orchestra layouts and the like, the effect is gimmicky rather than inevitable (there are even tiny drumsticks to beat on pop-up drums). The real plus in educating readers about serious music is, paradoxically, the least visual: a 75-minute, well-annotated CD that includes a surprisingly eclectic selection of "Twenty Masterpieces" with only one real chestnut-the Hallelujah Chorus from Messiah-and such august choices as pieces by Josquin, Palestrina and Monteverdi, as well as unhackneyed moments from Bach, Mozart, Debussy, Wagner, Verdi, even Janacek. Plenty of novelty value, a fun gift, but don't expect the impact of Art Pack. 100,000 printing; BOMC alternate. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.This impressive gift-sized package is highly recommended for year-round giving to any avid music fan. Blend paper instruments you can take out and 'play' with instructional pop-ups and a 75-minute CD and you have a blend of music history and creative applications which should interest all ages. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>The Yoga Sutra of Patanjali</h2><p>Yoga is meant to elevate the spirit of every man, not to teach how to levitate.

Evans thrusts her signature character Farideh into a maelstrom of devilish politics and magical intrigue that will have far-reaching implications for the future of the Forgotten Realms.<br><br>As the chaos of the Sundering rages around her, young warlock Farideh faces a more personal turmoil wrought by a deal she made with a devil years ago. Hoping to protect her twin sister, she leaves everything she holds dear to assist a wizard in a scheme that pits the devils of the Nine Hells against the gods above. <br><br>But when Farideh casts the spell to enter the wizard&#x2019;s remote mountaintop fortress, she picks up a stowaway&#x2014;a Harper agent named Dahl who isn&#x2019;t so inclined to follow devilish demands. Dahl attempts to escape only to run into a village of odd people, lurking behind an impenetrable wall. <br>Forced to gaze into the villagers&#x2019; souls, Farideh points out the ones who seem different, only to watch as the wizard&#x2019;s guard carts them off to fates unknown. Are these villagers or prisoners? Are they blessed or doomed by the gods? As the wizard&#x2019;s guessing game proves more and more diabolical, Farideh resolves to unravel his secrets&#x2014;even if it means she&#x2019;ll lose her own soul to the Nine Hells.</p></p><p>ERIN M.

Cotton tycoon Mary Toliver and timber magnate Percy Warwick should have married but unwisely did not, and now must deal with the deceit, secrets, and tragedies of their choice and the loss of what might have been--not just for themselves but for their children, and children's children. With expert, unabashed, big-canvas storytelling, <em>Roses</em> covers a hundred years, three generations of Texans and the explosive combination of passion for work and longing for love.</p><p>Leila Meacham is a writer and former teacher who lives in San Antonio, Texas.Coleen Marlo delivers an old-fashioned sprawling, multigenerational rags-to-riches tale with a healthy supply of steamy unrequited romance, all played out in the American heartland. Marlo is every bit a match for this material as she gives a strong performance that endows each character with personality and convincing emotions. She keeps the tension high, excelling in portraying Mary Toliver&#39;s relentless drive to save her family&#39;s plantation--to the detriment of all else--while also making clear what it&#39;s costing her to do so. By the time listeners reach Mary&#39;s granddaughter in the third generation, they will have a real feel for the ambiance and history of Texas. D.G. � AudioFile 2010, Portland, Maine</p><h2>The Long Summer: How Climate Changed Civilization</h2><p>For more than a century we&#39;ve known that much of human evolution occurred in an Ice Age. Starting about 15,000 years ago, temperatures began to rise, the glaciers receded, and sea levels rose. The rise of human civilization and all of recorded history occurred in this warm period, known as the Holocene.Until very recently we had no detailed record of climate changes during the Holocene. Now we do. In this engrossing and captivating look at the human effects of climate variability, Brian Fagan shows how climate functioned as what the historian Paul Kennedy described as one of the &#34;deeper transformations&#34; of history--a more important historical factor than we understand.</p><p>A professor of anthropology by training, Fagan traces the effects of climactic change on civilizations over the past 15,000 years--a period of prolonged global warning that has only accelerated over the past 150 years. In particular, he's interested in how civilizations have responded to, or been radically altered by, changes in environment. One of Fagan's most compelling examples is his detailed history of the city of Ur, in what is now modern-day Iraq. Once a great city in one of the world's earliest civilizations, it first thrived thanks to abundant rainfall and then suffered even more severely when the Indian Ocean monsoons shifted southward, changing rain patterns. By 2000 B.C. its agricultural economy had collapsed, and today it is an abandoned landscape, an assemblage of decaying shrines in the harshest of deserts. Fagan views this event as pivotal. It was, he writes, "the first time an entire city disintegrated in the face of environmental catastrophe." But not, Fagan notes, the last. In his epilogue, which covers the last 800 years of human history, Fagan explores the climatic upheavals that left 20 million dead in famine-related epidemics in the 19th century. He notes that today 200 million people barely survive on marginal agricultural land in places such as northeastern Brazil, Ethiopia, and the Saharan Sahel. If temperatures rise much above current levels, and rising seas flood coastal plains, the devastation could dwarf any disaster humankind has previously known. Fagan doesn't offer easy solutions, but he presents a compelling history of climate's role in the background--and sometimes foreground--of human history. <i>--Keith Moerer</i><b>Brian Fagan</b> is Emeritus Professor of Anthropology at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

Confronted by one crisis after another, they struggled to protect the country, remake the world, and define their own relationship along the way. In <i>Days of Fire</i>, Peter Baker chronicles the history of the most consequential presidency in modern times through the prism of its two most compelling characters, capturing the elusive and shifting alliance of George Walker Bush and Richard Bruce Cheney as no historian has done before. He brings to life with in-the-room immediacy all the drama of an era marked by devastating terror attacks, the Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina, and financial collapse. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The real story of Bush and Cheney is a far more fascinating tale than the familiar suspicion that Cheney was the power behind the throne. Drawing on hundreds of interviews with key players, and thousands of pages of never-released notes, memos, and other internal documents, Baker paints a riveting portrait of a partnership that evolved dramatically over time, from the early days when Bush leaned on Cheney, making him the most influential vice president in history, to their final hours, when the two had grown so far apart they were clashing in the West Wing. Together and separately, they were tested as no other president and vice president have been, first on a bright September morning, an unforgettable &#x201c;day of fire&#x201d; just months into the presidency, and on countless days of fire over the course of eight tumultuous years.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Days of Fire</i> is a monumental and definitive work that will rank with the best of presidential histories. As absorbing as a thriller, it is eye-opening and essential reading.</p></p><p><p>Peter Baker is&nbsp;the Chief&nbsp;White House Correspondent for<i> The New York Times</i> and a regular panelist on <i>Washington Week</i> on PBS. He is the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>The Breach</i>, about Bill Clinton&#x2019;s impeachment, and, with his wife, Susan Glasser, of <i>Kremlin Rising</i>, about Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s Russia.</p><i>Excerpted from the Hardcover Edition<br></i><br><br>Part one<br><br>1<br><br>&#x201c;One of you could be president&#x201d;<br><br>George W. Bush had already dropped by to see three congressmen when he strode down the high-ceilinged corridor of the Cannon House Office Building to find the fourth on his list. It was June 17, 1987, and the son of the vice president was making the rounds to gather support for his father&#x2019;s presidential campaign, or at least build goodwill with Republicans on Capitol Hill. His 3:30 p.m. appointment was with a low-key congressman from Wyoming named Dick Cheney.<br><br>This next-generation Bush was a tall, rangy man, handsome with an easy smile and a face that bore a striking resemblance to that of his famous father. Just a couple weeks shy of his forty-first birthday, he had moved his wife and twin daughters to Washington for the campaign, appointing himself &#x201c;loyalty enforcer&#x201d; to ensure a growing staff of political operatives was laboring on behalf of George H. W. Bush&#x2019;s interests rather than their own.<br><br>Along the way, he was becoming a surrogate for his father and was surprised how much he enjoyed his new role. This family business had gotten into his blood. He had none of his father&#x2019;s smoothness, though, and none of those polished New England sensibilities. Junior, as some called him, although he was not technically a junior, lived closer to the edge, the &#x201c;Roman candle of the family,&#x201d; as the campaign chronicler Richard Ben Cramer would call him, &#x201c;the biggest and most jagged chip off the old block.&#x201d;<br><br>By temperament, the man he was visiting was quite the opposite. Cheney, a former White House chief of staff now in his fifth term in Congress, was as quiet as Bush was voluble, as stoic as the younger man was expressive. He would say what he had to and then stop, perfectly comfortable with the silences that disquieted others. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not necessarily what you would call the life of the party,&#x201d; observed Dennis Hastert, who served with him in the House and went on to become Speaker. Cheney&#x2019;s wife, Lynne, thought the way to understand him was to remember how much he loved fly-fishing, standing without a sound for hours casting for a bite&#x2014;&#x201d;not a sport for the impatient,&#x201d; as she put it, and &#x201c;definitely not a sport for chatterboxes.&#x201d; He refused to go fishing with his friend Kenneth Adelman because &#x201c;he talks too much.&#x201d; At forty-six, Cheney had just been promoted to chairman of the House Republican Conference, the number-three position in the party leadership. He had his eye on someday becoming Speaker.<br><br>Neither man in the years to come would remember the first time they met, but it was likely this encounter in the summer before the Republican primaries. Never mind that Cheney had no intention of taking sides in the Republican contest featuring Bush&#x2019;s father. To a congressman eyeing further moves up the leadership ladder, becoming a partisan for a presidential candidate would be &#x201c;asking for grief I didn&#x2019;t need,&#x201d; as Cheney later put it. Indeed, his neutrality would cause a years-long rift with his good friend and mentor, Donald Rumsfeld, who had been contemplating his own run for president. But Cheney got along well with his guest that day. &#x201c;He and Bush hit it off,&#x201d; recalled Wayne Berman, the campaign&#x2019;s congressional relations director who organized the meeting.<br><br>Berman would go on to become one of Washington&#x2019;s premier lobbyists and Republican fund-raisers, as well as one of the few men close to both Bush and Cheney. He raised millions of dollars for them, promoted their campaigns, and hosted dinners for them at his house. His wife, Lea Berman, would work in the White House first for Cheney&#x2019;s wife and then for Bush&#x2019;s wife. But even Wayne Berman never imagined what would eventually come of the acquaintance that began in that courtesy call one summer afternoon. &#x201c;Bush in those days was a really interesting guy,&#x201d; he observed years later. &#x201c;A little insecure, had a bit of a chip on his shoulder. Very skeptical of everything in Washington, something I think he retained. Skeptical of a lot of people around his dad.&#x201d; As for Cheney, he was more comfortable with Washington yet also kept his distance. The only ones he truly relaxed around were his wife and two daughters. &#x201c;Cheney has three confidantes, and all their last names are Cheney,&#x201d; Berman noted. &#x201c;One is related by marriage and two by blood.&#x201d; He could be unguarded with friends, &#x201c;but if he told you something and it leaked and he suspected you leaked it, you didn&#x2019;t get a second chance. Finished.&#x201d;<br><br>Bush at that point had yet to win public office and was still evolving into the politician he would later become. When he visited the West Wing in those days, he would stop by offices of aides he knew, plop down on a couch, and put his cowboy boots on the coffee table. Ronald Reagan, who had met the Bush children, thought that if any of them had a bright political future, it would be George&#x2019;s brother Jeb. Their brother Marvin once gave his assessment of each sibling. &#x201c;George?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;George is the family clown.&#x201d;<br><br>Indeed, after their father won the presidency, the younger George attended a state dinner for Queen Elizabeth II, lifted his pant legs to show her his cowboy boots, and proudly declared that he was the black sheep in the family. &#x201c;Do you have any in yours?&#x201d; he asked. What was certainly a defense mechanism for a son and grandson of accomplished men also became a conscious strategy of lowering expectations. &#x201c;It is always better to lowball these things,&#x201d; he once told a general years later in a revealing moment during a conference call about Iraq. &#x201c;If you perform, people are surprised.&#x201d; He added, &#x201c;I really enjoy it when somebody says, that son of a bitch just got out a coherent sentence.&#x201d;<br><br>The day Bush met Cheney came less than a year after a radical midlife course correction. Although he never accepted the word &#x201c;alcoholic,&#x201d; Bush&#x2019;s decision to quit drinking the day after his fortieth birthday reshaped his outlook on life, manifesting itself as both empathy and determination. The man who conquered his own weakness would stop whatever he was doing upon meeting an addict. &#x201c;His cadence would change,&#x201d; said David Kuo, a former aide. &#x201c;He would put both of his hands on the man&#x2019;s shoulders and look into his eyes. Any swagger disappeared. Something softer and perhaps more genuine took its place.&#x201d; At the same time, the iron discipline it took to stop cold turkey would become a never-look-back approach to the Oval Office; he could be at once maddeningly stubborn about revisiting decisions and indefatigably upbeat in the face of crises that would leave other presidents talking to the paintings.<br><br>It may have also fueled an urgent idealism that would characterize his presidency for better or worse; on some level, he believed he had been saved to accomplish great things. His zeal inspired supporters with its promise of transformation while dismaying critics as dangerously messianic. Bush&#x2019;s favorite book was The Raven, a Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning biography that traced the life of Sam Houston from drunkard to president of the Republic of Texas. &#x201c;His first thought, his constant thought, was to atone for the period of his delinquency,&#x201d; the author, Marquis James, wrote of Houston. &#x201c;He would do something grand. He would capture an empire.&#x201d;<br><br>Grandiosity never defined Cheney. He was, as the writer Todd Purdum once observed, &#x201c;a never-complain, never-explain politician who reminded many of the younger officials and journalists who came to know him of their fathers.&#x201d; A man who would survive five heart attacks, the first at age thirty-seven, Cheney demonstrated a grit he rarely got credit for, one that fostered a single-minded intensity to get things done regardless of others&#x2019; sensibilities. &#x201c;I suppose it gives him a sense of you can&#x2019;t count on being here forever and you have to accomplish what you can accomplish while you can,&#x201d; his daughter Liz observed. His own mortality never far from mind, Cheney adopted a cold-eyed view of what was needed to protect the life of the country, never entertaining a moment of doubt over tactics that would cause others to recoil.<br><br>Trent Lott, who served with him in the House before becoming Senate majority leader, remembered skiing with Cheney once in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where the future vice president had a vacation home. Lott was decked out in a fancy outfit and red coat, while Cheney showed up at the lift in jeans, red scarf, and ragged old jacket that &#x201c;looked like something a sailor would have worn in 1945.&#x201d; Cheney took off &#x201c;and all I saw for the next two miles was that red scarf flapping in the breeze as I skidded down the run on my butt,&#x201d; Lott recalled. &#x201c;He came up, very unimpressive looking, nothing fancy, skied like a wild man going down that run. I said that&#x2019;s the real Dick Cheney. I looked good and he skied good.&#x201d;<br><br>Cheney&#x2019;s DNA was missing that politician&#x2019;s gene attuned to reputation, a trait that served him well for decades, only to betray him at the end as he allowed himself to be reduced to a cartoon figure in the public mind. &#x201c;I think years ago, the rooms in his brain that normal people devote to keeping score of slights and Beyonc� and popular culture, he moved all the furniture out of those rooms and stuffed them full of file cabinets about GDP and throw weights and all that kind of stuff,&#x201d; said Pete Williams, who worked for Cheney on Capitol Hill and at the Pentagon. &#x201c;He is fundamentally a very serious man.&#x201d; And because Cheney flunked out of Yale and never became part of the club, he never felt beholden. &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t have the blue blazer, he didn&#x2019;t have the crest, and he didn&#x2019;t have the whale belt and the purple pants and all that stuff,&#x201d; Williams said. &#x201c;There is no Ivy League thing, there is no big city thing, there is no prep school thing. He went to a public high school. So I think what that means is he came here pretty much on his own two feet. I think that that has always given him a great deal of self-confidence. That plays out in a number of ways. I think it liberated him to follow his own conscience. He didn&#x2019;t have chits to repay, he didn&#x2019;t have errands to run, he didn&#x2019;t have to worry about being ostracized if he took a view that was unorthodox. He just took the measure of himself and that was enough.&#x201d;<br><br>George Walker Bush and Richard Bruce Cheney were born five and a half years and a world apart. Bush arrived on July 6, 1946, in New Haven, Connecticut, joining a blue-blazer-and-whale-belt family with a rarefied history dating back to the Mayflower. His mother, the former Barbara Pierce, was a distant cousin of President Franklin Pierce&#x2019;s, while his father, George Herbert Walker Bush, had roots tied by researchers to fifteen American presidents and the British royal family. His grandparents traveled in the same circles as the Rockefellers, Tafts, Luces, Grahams, Harrimans, Lodges, Fulbrights, and Kennedys. Cheney was born on January 30, 1941, in Lincoln, Nebraska, to a family of New Deal Democrats who struggled through the Great Depression and were proud their oldest son was born on Franklin Roosevelt&#x2019;s birthday. His grandparents had lost everything in the crisis except their house. His father, Richard Herbert Cheney, dropped out of college and worked for decades for the Soil Conservation Service teaching farmers how to rotate crops. His mother, Marjorie Dickey, waited tables at the family-owned Dickey&#x2019;s Caf� in Syracuse, Nebraska, until meeting the young public servant. At various points growing up, Dick lived on an uncle&#x2019;s farm and in a family friend&#x2019;s basement.<br><br>Yet from such disparate beginnings, the two future partners would travel familiar paths. Bush&#x2019;s parents eschewed the easy life in the East to move to hardscrabble Texas oil country, and the Cheneys headed to the frontier of Wyoming, with the boys raised in settings not all that different. &#x201c;There is a similarity, to a certain extent, between West Texas and Casper, Wyoming, in look and feel,&#x201d; observed Dean McGrath, who spent years working for Cheney. &#x201c;It is a long, long way between places. There was openness and expanse that when people in the West talk about, people on the East Coast don&#x2019;t get.&#x201d; From their western upbringings came strong views about the American ethos and an equally strong detachment from the coasts that dominated national life. As McGrath put it, &#x201c;They are both pretty conservative, they are both pretty free market, they are both pretty free trade, and they both have pretty strong social values.&#x201d;<br><br>Nostalgia naturally shrouded the places that shaped Bush and Cheney in romantic hues, but friends describe them in similar terms, as towns where doors were left unlocked, boys played baseball day after day, and everyone knew each other&#x2019;s business. Midland was a &#x201c;little Mayberry type of town,&#x201d; as Bush&#x2019;s lifelong friend Joe O&#x2019;Neill remembered it, while Joe Meyer, Cheney&#x2019;s high school pal, described Casper as something out of Happy Days. They were towns on the rise, flush with oil and the entrepreneurs who chased it. Midland was the capital of the Permian Basin, which produced nearly 20 percent of America&#x2019;s oil in the 1950s. Casper was called the oil capital of the Rockies. Both towns were formed in the 1880s and topped twenty thousand residents in 1950; Casper had doubled in size since 1920, while Midland had quadrupled since 1930 and would triple again over the next decade. By the time the Bushes bought their first house in Midland, 215 oil companies had opened offices there. Both towns were arid, but Midland was flat and brown, prone to tumbleweed and sandstorms, while Casper was greener, perched at the base of a mountain and nearly as high as Denver.<br><br>The Bushes came from money, of course, but family tradition dictated that each generation make its own. Prescott Bush, young George&#x2019;s grandfather, who went by Pres, had refused his father&#x2019;s inheritance and helped round up investors in early American icons like CBS, Prudential, and Pan Am. He helped Dresser Industries reorganize and go public with a Yale University friend, Neil Mallon, at the helm. George H. W. Bush, the youngest commissioned navy combat pilot in World War II and a star baseball player at Yale, set off for Texas in 1948 to make his own mark. That&#x2019;s not to say family connections were unavailable. It was Mallon who gave him a job at a Dresser subsidiary in Odessa. But he had to start as an equipment clerk. It was a hard, peripatetic life in modest homes for years until oil began paying off. Settling in Odessa, the family rented a two-room duplex, sharing a bathroom with a mother-and-daughter prostitute team next door. After a yearlong transfer to California, where the family bounced around five different homes, they returned to Texas in 1950, this time to Midland.</p><h2>Tongue: A Creative Force Gift Edition</h2><p>Words are the most powerful things in the universe!

But new research from neuroscien�tists and psychologists suggests that, in fact, the brain reorganizes, improves in important functions, and even helps us adopt a more optimistic outlook in middle age. Growth of white matter and brain connectors allow us to recognize patterns faster, make better judgments, and find unique solutions to problems. Scientists call these traits cognitive expertise and they reach their highest levels in middle age. <br><br> In her impeccably researched book, science writer Barbara Strauch explores the latest findings that demonstrate, through the use of technology such as brain scans, that the middle-aged brain is more flexible and more capable than previously thought. For the first time, long-term studies show that our view of middle age has been misleading and incomplete. By detailing exactly the normal, healthy brain functions over time, Strauch also explains how its optimal processes can be maintained. Part scientific survey, part how-to guide, <i>The Secret Life of the Grown-Up Brain</i> is a fascinating glimpse at our surprisingly talented middle-aged minds.</p><p><i>Barbara Strauch</i> is health and medical science editor and a deputy science editor at <i>The New York Times</i> and the author of <i>The Primal Teen: What the New Discoveries About the Teenage Brain Tell Us About Our Kids</i>.

The first took place on May 6, 2002, when an animal-rights advocate, for obscure reasons, gunned down Pim Fortuyn, a charismatic politician with a populist program combining law-and-order conservatism, opposition to immigration and gay liberation. About a year and a half later a young Dutch Muslim of Moroccan descent, incensed by a film critical of Islam, shot the filmmaker-provocateur Theo van Gogh dead in broad daylight. As a parting gesture, he pinned a manifesto to the twitching body with a knife. It was all, as the prime minister of the Netherlands put it, "un-Dutch." <br><br> Well, perhaps more Dutch than it seemed, Ian Buruma proposes in his shrewd, subtly argued inquiry into the tensions and resentments underlying two of the most shocking events in the recent history of the Netherlands. For one thing, both killers traveled to the crime scene by bicycle. More seriously, both murders represented the sort of highly pitched moral confrontation that could be regarded as a Dutch specialty. The killings were, in a sense, "principled murders." <br><br> Mr. Buruma writes ,"It is a characteristic of Calvinism to hold moral principles too rigidly, and this might be considered a vice as well as a virtue of the Dutch." <br><br> Mr. Buruma has made a career of examining foreign cultures, usually Asian, in books like "God's Dust: A Modern Asian Journey" and "Inventing Japan." The murders of Mr. van Gogh and Mr. Fortuyn took him to an unexpected place, his own country. <br><br> Mr. Buruma grew up in The Hague, but the country to which he returns in this book is virtually unrecognizable to him, transformed by large numbers of Muslim immigrants from Turkey and Morocco. The multicultural experiment, despite the government's liberal immigration policies and lavish social services, has not gone well, and Mr. Buruma wants to find out why. <br><br> There is no single answer, he discovers, as he sits down with social workers, historians, politicians and writers, some Dutch, others immigrants or the children of immigrants. There are, however, promising avenues to explore, and this he does, economically and suggestively. He traces the evolution of the Netherlands from a sleepy, racially homogenous country to a multicultural haven for immigrants, many Muslim. He also delves into the personal histories of the victims and their assassins, trying to expose the social fault lines that led to murder. The connecting theme is immigration and its discontents, felt by guests and hosts alike. <br><br> The improbable Mr. Fortuyn tapped into deep public anxiety over immigration, globalism and national character. Personally outrageous, he hurled abuse at the smooth face of Dutch liberalism, ridiculing its tolerance for Islamic cultural practices that conflicted with social freedom. <br><br> Mr. van Gogh, a social gadfly who once described himself as the national village idiot, made a point of offending Islam, just as he made a point of offending the political establishment and anything else within reach: he once called Jesus "that rotten fish from Nazareth." He miscalculated when, with the Somali immigrant Ayaan Hirsi Ali, he made "Submission," a film in which lines from the Koran on the role of women were projected onto naked female bodies. <br><br> The Dutch, Mr. Buruma writes, savor irony, and perhaps because their political establishment is so dull, enjoy the politics of outrage. This taste is not shared by the country's Muslim immigrants. "This was the crowning irony of his life," Mr. Buruma writes. "Van Gogh, more than anyone, had warned about the dangers of violent religious passions, and yet he behaved as though they held no consequences for him." <br><br> Dutch by upbringing, Mr. Buruma manages to pick up on nuances and historical threads that other writers might easily overlook. He maintains that the argument over immigration cannot be understood without seeing the long shadow of World War II and Anne Frank. Questions of national identity, race and tolerance bear heavy freight. "Never again, said the well-meaning defenders of the multicultural ideal, must Holland betray a religious minority," Mr. Buruma writes. <br><br> That minority seethes. In particular, the offspring of poor, often illiterate Berbers from Morocco have fared poorly in the Netherlands, and Mr. Buruma, with great finesse, explores the sense of displacement and cultural alienation of Muhammad Bouyeri, Mr. van Gogh's killer, and other young Muslim men drawn to Islamic fundamentalism. For the products of rigid tribal societies, Dutch freedom has often proved to be oppressive, and here Mr. Buruma suggests that Islam might not be the main point. <br><br> "More important," he writes, "was the question of authority, of face, in a household where the father could give little guidance, and in a society from which a young Moroccan male might find it easier to receive subsidies than respect." <br><br> Mr. Fortuyn had a simple solution. Foreigners who did not subscribe to Dutch values should leave. Enlightenment absolutists like Ms. Hirsi Ali and Mr. van Gogh turned apoplectic at any efforts to appease or accommodate Muslims on, say, gay rights or women's rights, and they were not alone in their fears. <br><br> "I find it terrible that we should be offering social welfare or subsidies to people who refuse to shake hands with a woman," a left-wing feminist tells Mr. Buruma. <br><br> Two murders have left the citizens of two cultures, living in the same country, staring at each other across a gulf and wondering how to move forward. Mr. Buruma is not sure, and at the end he disappears in a puff of rhetorical smoke. With the battle lines drawn, he expresses the fond hope that reason and moderation will prevail on both sides. The sentiment falls sweetly on ears tuned to that particular frequency. The question is how to transmit it to a fanatic on a bicycle. -- <i><i>New York Times</i>, September 13, 2006</i><br><br>It was already a dreary, late-autumn morning in Amsterdam when Mohammed Bouyeri made it that much drearier by blasting filmmaker and provocateur Theo van Gogh off his bicycle. He then slashed van Gogh's throat, planted the knife in van Gogh's chest, and used another to pin a note to him, a rambling tract calling for a holy war against unbelievers. Then Bouyeri kicked the corpse. He was arrested after a gunfight with police. <br><br> "Murder in Amsterdam" is Ian Buruma's exploration of the event, its context and fallout. It is a work of philosophical and narrative tension, strikingly sharp and brooding, frank and openly curious. Which is apt, for here is the Netherlands -- home to the Enlightenment, bastion of tolerance -- experiencing an act of mortal intolerance. The Netherlands, where multiculturalism is worn on its sleeve, meets its evil twin. <br><br> Just how elastic is tolerance, asks Buruma? If the Netherlands wears multiculturalism on its sleeve, it doesn't necessarily follow that untold numbers of sober, conformist Netherlanders find the garment a comfortable fit. Tolerance has its limits, he writes. "It is easy to tolerate those who are much like ourselves, whom we feel we can trust instinctively, whose jokes we understand, who share our sense of irony. ... It is much harder to extend the same principle to strangers in our midst, who find our ways as disturbing as we do theirs." <br><br> The rows in the multicultural garden proved more and more difficult to hoe, for the Dutch and for, in particular, the significant immigrant population of Muslims. With their radically different worldview, many Muslims were not about to be absorbed willy-nilly into Dutch democratic liberalism. They would stick to their own institutions, especially after the resentment of having one too many doors shut in their face, or when Dutch freedoms -- sexual, religious, artistic, political, you name it -- were perceived as a threat. These Muslims would seek comfort in the reinvention of tradition on new turf. <br><br> What is multiculturalism in this instance if not the ideal of a complacent elite, a tolerance of intolerance? asked some high-profile Dutch. Buruma, a Dutch native living in the United States, draws sharp portraits of three: Pim Fortuyn, the gay, populist outsider who almost became prime minister; the anti-Islam, Somali-born politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali; and van Gogh, "with his unfailing instinct for the low blow." <br><br> Fortuyn voiced sentiments of cultural homogeneity and a loathing of religious strictures, writes Buruma, concocting a dreamy family-state, with a shared language, culture and history. Foreigners rocked the family-state boat. " 'How dare you!' he fulminated. ... 'This is our country, and if you can't conform, you should get the hell out.' " Campy, mocking, aggrieved, Fortuyn's popularity attested to touching a raw Dutch nerve. He was assassinated by an animal-rights activist who objected to his vanity, opportunism and fur collars. <br><br> Ali has pulled no punches in her excoriation of Islam. She suffered firsthand the torments that can be visited upon females living in a fundamentalist Islamic state. Such Islam is a force of darkness, she says, inimical to the health of an enlightened country like the Netherlands. Widely respected, Ali has also made enemies across the spectrum in her role as Islam's Voltaire: a heretic, a "filthy indigenous clone," a snake in the multicultural Eden. Van Gogh was her friend, with whom she made the short film "Submission," a contentious broadside at Islam as a cage imprisoning women. <br><br> This was van Gogh's cup of tea. A self-ordained "village idiot," the court jester with license to spill Truth, he loved a good row. He epitomized a rude, free-spirited anarchism of poking fun at convention. Catholic, Jew, Muslim -- all felt his barb. Living in the Netherlands, he believed that he could give unlimited offense without fear of physical retribution. He was mistaken. <br><br> Buruma does his most vigilant probing of Mohammed Bouyeri, a textbook on the retreat into fundamentalism. The pot-smoking youth gave way under a series of setbacks and rejections. His Islamic upbringing was tugged from the shadows. He became uncomfortable with all the choices in Dutch society, and disgusted by its value system. Increasingly priggish and moralistic, he fashioned a world out of fantasy, paranoia, tribal honor and religious rectitude. Islamic purism provided sustenance and authenticity amid the earthly evils. <br><br> "Submission" stuck in Bouyeri's craw. He would become a knight of Allah, a destroyer of the civilization that tormented him, a dispenser of divine law -- the ordinates of a murderous narcissism -- with violent death his cleansing agent. "The impulse to seek oblivion, to be intoxicated and overwhelmed by a great force, is not rare," writes Buruma. Life in jail is a great place to find oblivion. <br><br> Readers can draw their own conclusions about the limits of tolerance. Burma is wary to provide a pat answers, though perhaps operating within a nation's rules of law is a sensible starting point. Still, as Ali might warn, try being a girl in Somalia. National rules of law may well be the death of you. -- <i><i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></i><br><br>Like many Dutch people, my wife found the news that the filmmaker Theo van Gogh had been murdered by a Muslim extremist shocking, in two senses of the word: shocking-tragic, and shocking-weird. She had worked with van Gogh, as producer of one of his television series in 1998, "Het Is Hier Verschrikkelijk Gezellig" ("It's Terribly Nice Here"). The show revolved around van Gogh insulting and humiliating people engaged in recreational activities he considered contemptible: executives playing paintball, couples flying off for "exotic weddings," swingers' clubs. (Today, we would call it "reality TV," but that term didn't exist yet; it was coined in 1999, also in the Netherlands, when a Dutch studio called Endemol came out with the original version of "Big Brother.") Van Gogh's public persona was that of a fat, abusive, witty, politically incorrect buffoon, equal parts Johnny Knoxville and Michael Moore, the self-proclaimed "dorpsgek" ("village idiot") of the Netherlands. That such a character should become a victim of international jihad seemed an absurd joke or category error, as though the 9/11 terrorists had tried to blow up the town of South Park. <br><br> "It's Terribly Nice Here" found van Gogh at a low ebb in his career. His shtick had begun to seem less repellently funny than just plain repellent. My wife's strongest visual memory of the director was of him passed out on the couch in the editing room, a beached whale in mismatched socks. But in subsequent years, van Gogh reestablished himself by taking on more serious projects, and turning his ridicule toward a new target: Islam. Starting in about 2000, anti-Muslim sentiments, once taboo in self-consciously tolerant Holland, were voiced with increasing openness and conviction. Van Gogh jumped on the bandwagon, saying a number of things that would probably have ended an American entertainer's career, notably his use of the epithet "goatfuckers." -- <i>Matt Steinglass, <i>Salon</i></i></p><h2>Poems, 1923-1954</h2><p>This complete collection includes almost 600 lyric poems from E.

More than #90,000 in losses later, Alexa discovers that money isn't what Damien has in mind. Convinced that his brother Peter killed himself because Alexa had spurned the attentions of a "penniless second son," Damien is determined to see that Alexa pays for his family's loss. The earl's suggestion that they meet privately to discuss her debt intrigues Alexa, as does the handsome earl himself. But when their meeting is observed and Alexa's reputation ruined, as he planned, Damien offers to marry her to protect her honor, deluding himself into thinking that a loveless marriage will be but another form of revenge. Martin's (Bold Angel) story is delightful and her character insights astute. Though Damien might easily have slipped into villainhood, the author rescues him with scenes that ring true-as when he visits Peter's grave with his mother. Martin also deftly manages the sometimes tricky task of injecting humor without compromising her characters or making them jokey. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A. P. Giannini: Banker of America</h2><p>Perhaps more than any other individual, Amadeo Peter Giannini brought California into the twentieth century. Extending credit to ordinary working people, creating a financial empire through his branch banks, this son of Italian immigrants enabled California to advance faster than any other state in the decades before World War II. But who was A. P. Giannini? Felice A. Bonadio's superior biography reveals the founder of Bank of America in his many roles, most notably that of a bold, ruthless financial genius keenly aware of his minority status in a world dominated by the eastern Protestant elite.<br><br>Yet this is more than the success story of an underdog. Bonadio profiles a man of immense talent who was relentlessly eager to serve "the people." Hard-driving, obsessive about defending his empire against its enemies, Giannini could be both a good hater and a good friend. He was one of the first American businessmen to promote employee ownership and profit sharing, and when he died in 1949 at age 79, nearly forty percent of B of A's shares were owned by its employees. Little interested in personal wealth, Giannini's own estate was modest at the time of his death.<br><br>Much of Bonadio's research is from the private papers of Federal Reserve Bank officials and confidential Bank of America archives. Recollections of Giannini family members and former bank executives are also here, lending historical resonance and color to this portrait of a man whose influence endures many years after his death.<br><br>Giannini prided himself on his compulsive work habits, which he justified with one of his frequently repeated aphorisms, "Be first in everything." Once, on horseback to solicit a consignment order from one of the valley's biggest growers, he suddenly spotted a competitor's team in the distance headed in the same direction. Remembering a deep slough that stood between him and the farm, he quickly cut across the field, tethered his horse to a tree, and swam to the other side. Then he ran the rest of the way to the farmhouse. By the time the other merchant had arrived, Giannini was negotiating a deal with the grower.</p><p><b>Felice A. Bonadio</b> is Professor of History at the University of California, Santa Barbara.Giannini was-in his own words-a man who wanted to "achieve big things" in life. The son of Italian immigrants, he set out to do just that by leading a Horatio Alger life that culminated in the founding of the Bank of America. But it wasn't easy. Confronted by implacable enemies (real and imagined), unforeseen natural disasters (the 1906 San Francisco earthquake), and international cataclysms (the world wars, the Great Depression), Giannini survived them all and thrived. In many ways his success paralleled that of California. Many new sources of information have been culled for this new biography; among the revelations is Giannini's fascination with Hollywood. But Giannini's greatest legacy came from his having "democratized the banking industry in California," his impact reaching to today. Bonadio (history, Univ. of California, Santa Barbara) presents a robustly written and readable work. Highly recommended for all public libraries. [For another look at Giannini, see Gerald N.

Bad news, it&#x2019;ll just be one person from the studio, the executive in charge of the project. I lifted the phone to my ear, feeling like the air had gained weight and my arm was moving through something with the consistency of tar. My heartbeat hammered in my ears. My jeans and T-shirt felt too small, the sunshine in my bedroom stabbed at my eyes, and the atmosphere felt thin, as if I was working harder than I normally did to pull oxygen into my lungs. Please, God, I thought&#x2014;me, the girl who hadn&#x2019;t been in a synagogue since my grandma and I had left Massachusetts, who&#x2019;d barely remembered to fast last Yom Kippur. But still. I was a woman who&#x2019;d lost her parents, who&#x2019;d survived a dozen surgeries and emerged with metal implants in my jaw, the right side of my face sunken and scarred, and an eye that drooped. In my twenty-eight years, I hadn&#x2019;t gotten much. I deserved this.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hello?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hold for Lisa Stark, please!&#x201d; came Lisa&#x2019;s assistant&#x2019;s singsong. My breath rushed out of me. Lisa was my executive at the studio. If she was the only one on the call, then this was the end of the road: the pass, the thanks-but-no-thanks. The no. I pushed my hair&#x2014;lank, brown, unwashed for the last three days&#x2014;behind my ears and sat on my bed. I would keep my dignity intact. I would not cry until the call was over.<br> <br>I had told myself to expect bad news; told myself, a thousand times, that the numbers were not in my favor. Each year, the network ordered hundreds of potential new programs, giving writers the thumbs-up and the money to go off and write a pilot script. Of those hundreds of scripts, anywhere from two to three dozen would actually be filmed, and of those, only a handful&#x2014;maybe four, maybe six, maybe as many as ten&#x2014;would get ordered to series. My sitcom, The Next Best Thing, loosely based on my own life with my grandmother, had made the first cut three months ago. I&#x2019;d quit my job as an assistant at Two Daves Productions in order to work full-time on the script, progressing through the steps from a single-sentence pitch&#x2014;a college graduate who&#x2019;s been laid off and her grandmother who&#x2019;s been dumped move to an upscale assisted-living facility in Miami, where the girl tries to make it as a chef and the grandmother tries to live without a boyfriend&#x2014;to a paragraph-long pilot summary, then a beat sheet detailing each scene, then a twelve-page outline, and, finally, a forty-page script.<br> <br>For months I&#x2019;d been writing, holed up in my bedroom, or carrying my computer to a neighborhood coffee shop, where I was surrounded by my more attractive peers, the ones who carried on long, loud telephone conversations in which they used the words my agent as often as possible, and did everything but prop tip cups and WRITER AT WORK signs in front of their laptops. I wrote draft after draft, turning each one over to the studio that had funded my efforts and to the network that would, I hoped, eventually air them. I considered each round of notes; I cut and edited, rewrote and rewrote again. I pored over books for expectant parents to give my characters just the right names, and spent days in the kitchens of local restaurants so I could nail the details of my heroine&#x2019;s job.<br> <br>Two weeks ago I&#x2019;d delivered the absolutely, positively final final draft. I&#x2019;d brushed my lips against every single one of the pages, kissing each one lightly before I slid the script into the hole-puncher, then slipped the brass brads through the holes and pushed them shut. To celebrate, I&#x2019;d taken Grandma out to lunch at the Ivy, at her insistence. My grandmother, a petite and stylish woman of a certain age, was a great fan of the tabloids. Any restaurant where the paparazzi were a regular presence on the sidewalk was a place she wanted to be.<br> <br>When we walked up to the stand, the ma�tre d&#x2019; looked at me&#x2014;in a plain black cotton shift dress and five-year-old zippered leather boots, with my laptop tucked under my arm&#x2014;and gave a small but discernible shrug. My grandmother stepped toward him, smiling. If I dressed to maximize comfort and minimize attention, in shades of black and gray and blue, with a single necklace and sensible shoes, my grandmother had style enough for the both of us. That day she wore a black-and-white linen dress with a black patent-leather belt and black canvas espadrilles with bows that tied at her ankles. Her necklace was made of vintage Bakelite beads in poppy red, and she had a matching red patent-leather clutch in her hand and a red silk flower tucked behind one ear.<br> <br>&#x201c;How are you today?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fine.&#x201d; The host&#x2019;s eyes lingered on her face as he tried to figure out if she was someone he should know, a screen star of yesteryear or one of the Real Housewives&#x2019; mothers. &#x201c;This is my granddaughter,&#x201d; said Grandma, and gave me a brisk poke in the small of my back. I stumbled obediently toward the podium with a can-you-believe-her look on my face, wishing I&#x2019;d worn a necklace or a flower, or had thought to carry a pretty purse, or to have purchased one in the first place. &#x201c;Ruthie is a writer.&#x201d; The man behind the podium could barely suppress his wince. Writer, of course, was not the magic word that would cause him to usher us to the finest table in the restaurant and send over a bottle of free Champagne. Maybe writing for TV was a big deal elsewhere in America. In Hollywood, it meant less than nothing. Television writers were as common as cat dirt, and anyone with a working laptop and a version of Final Draft on her hard drive could claim to be one. You could almost see the word nobodies in a balloon floating above the man&#x2019;s neatly barbered head as he led us to a table so far in the back it was practically in the kitchen. &#x201c;Ladies,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>Grandma paused and rested her hand on the man&#x2019;s forearm. She tilted her face up toward his, batted her eyelashes, and gave him her gentle smile. &#x201c;Would it be possible for us to have a booth? Or a table with a little more light?&#x201d; Even at her age&#x2014;seventy-six, although she&#x2019;d have shot me if I&#x2019;d said it out loud&#x2014;her skin was still smooth, her eyes still bright, face vivid with rouge and lipstick, eyeliner and curling false lashes. Her waist was still slim, and her teeth were all her own. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re celebrating.&#x201d;<br> <br>He smiled back&#x2014;it is, I have learned over the years, almost impossible to resist my grandma&#x2019;s smile&#x2014;and led us to a booth halfway between the open front porch lined with white umbrellas, where the stars would pose and preen for the cameras, and the dim back room, where the nobodies were sequestered. We shared pasta and a chopped salad, had a glass of wine apiece, and split tiramisu for dessert. As we ate, Grandma told me stories from the set of OR, the medical drama where she&#x2019;d been working as an extra that week. &#x201c;The kids they bring in,&#x201d; she complained, running the edge of her spoon along the ridge of whipped cream that topped the tiramisu. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re out partying all night, so by the time they get in their gurneys, they&#x2019;re exhausted. One of the ADs has to run around set five minutes before every take just making sure they&#x2019;re not sleeping.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tough gig,&#x201d; I said. Grandma herself was spending eight hours a day sitting in the fake OR&#x2019;s fake waiting room. Every day, from ten in the morning until six o&#x2019;clock at night, with union-mandated breaks for lunch and snacks, she&#x2019;d get paid to do what she might have done for free on a normal day&#x2014;sit in an uncomfortable plastic chair with a tote bag of knitting in her lap, looking somewhere between bored and worried as she waited for her name to be called.<br> <br>&#x201c;You have to respect them,&#x201d; she said, nibbling at the strawberry that sat on the side of the dessert plate. &#x201c;Finding a way to get paid for sleeping. That&#x2019;s initiative.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nice work if you can get it,&#x201d; I said, and flagged down our waiter, and paid the bill. Then Grandma had gone back to the Radford lot in the Valley, a neighborhood ten miles away from and ten degrees hotter than Hollywood, where a number of television shows and movies were shot, and I drove back to Hancock Park, a pretty neighborhood with spacious sidewalks and green lawns, to our apartment in a Spanish-style building called the Moroccan, to wait.<br> <br>The network had started picking up its comedies a week after our lunch. I&#x2019;d spent my days with my phone in my hand, from the moment I opened my eyes to the moment I closed them. I would perch the phone on the edge of the sink while I showered or brushed my teeth, and sleep with it plugged in underneath my pillow. My thumb was permanently hovering over the keypad, hitting &#x201c;Refresh&#x201d; on Deadline Hollywood and L.A. Confidential and all of the websites that covered the industry. I&#x2019;d quit going to the gym after I realized how much I was annoying my fellow swimmers by pausing at the end of each lap to check my phone, which I&#x2019;d stowed in a waterproof plastic Ziploc bag and left by the deep end. I was too nervous to sit through a meal, but I was snacking constantly, eating bags of pretzels and dehydrated carrot chips and Pirate&#x2019;s Booty and sunflower seeds that I didn&#x2019;t really want, and ignoring my boyfriend Gary&#x2019;s phone calls, because there was, we&#x2019;d learned, nothing he could say or do that would possibly calm me down.<br> <br>Now here was my news, I thought, waiting for Lisa to get on the line, and the news wasn&#x2019;t good. Oh, well. At least I&#x2019;d be disappointed in private. After I&#x2019;d made the mistake of telling Grandma that I should be hearing something this week, she&#x2019;d announced her intention of giving me my space. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need an old woman breathing down your neck,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said, all the while hovering within five feet of my person, dressed in her at-home attire of lounging pajamas or a brilliantly embroidered silk robe, her slippered feet noiseless on the wooden floors as she found one task after another to keep her busy, and nearby. So far she&#x2019;d polished the silver, rearranged the china, emptied, scrubbed, bleached, and refilled the kitchen cupboards and the refrigerator, and regrouted the powder-room tile. That morning while we drank the smoothies she&#x2019;d made of pineapple and mango and Greek yogurt, she&#x2019;d announced her plans to rent a steamer and replace the dining-room wallpaper, even though I&#x2019;d begged her to leave that job to the professionals.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nu?&#x201d; she&#x2019;d ask casually, just once every night, as she served dinner to me and Maurice, her gentleman caller. As usual, her nerves were made manifest in the reemergence of her Boston accent and in her cooking. On Friday, when the first wave of pickups was announced, she&#x2019;d prepared a standing rib roast, Yorkshire pudding, potatoes au gratin, and homemade horseradish sauce. On Saturday, she&#x2019;d served a breast of veal stuffed with cornbread and sausage and studded with garlic and rosemary, and on Sunday, she&#x2019;d produced an entire Thanksgiving dinner, complete with two kinds of potatoes and a turkey she&#x2019;d brined in the hot tub (our down-the-hall neighbors, devoted fitness buffs, had howled when they&#x2019;d gone up to the roof for a little post-hike relaxation and found, instead of clear water, a fragrant brew of bay leaves and garlic cloves and juniper berries, with a kosher turkey bobbing merrily in the middle).<br> <br>I would pick at my food, then excuse myself, telling Grandma and Maurice that I needed to work, closing my bedroom door behind me. Of course, I wasn&#x2019;t working. I was staring at my phone, trying to will it to ring, and when I wasn&#x2019;t doing that, I was dialing the first nine of the ten numbers that would have connected me with Dave, the only person I really wanted to talk to.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ruth?&#x201d; The voice on the other end of the line startled me so badly that I gave a little squeak. The assistant, who had probably grown accustomed to the quirks of neurotic writers, pretended not to notice. &#x201c;I have Lisa on the line. Please hold for Tariq, and Lloyd and Joan from the network.&#x201d; I got to my feet, my heart lifting as quickly as it had sunk. The network. Oh God oh God oh God. The network doesn&#x2019;t call unless it&#x2019;s a pickup, Dave had said. They give the bad news to the agent, not the writer, and probably you&#x2019;ll read it online before someone has the decency to tell you to your face that your show is dead. But maybe Dave was wrong. It had been years since his own show was green-lit, years since he&#x2019;d had to sit in breathless, chest-pounding agony, waiting for the call, this call.<br> <br>Voices came back on the line, one after another, ringing like bells.<br> <br>&#x201c;I have Tariq,&#x201d; said Tariq&#x2019;s assistant.<br> <br>&#x201c;Holding for Joan,&#x201d; said Joan&#x2019;s.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ruth?&#x201d; asked Lisa. &#x201c;Still there?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here.&#x201d; My voice was faint and quivery. I stood up, clenching my fists, my jaw, my abdominal muscles, trying to keep from shaking.<br> <br>&#x201c;Please hold,&#x201d; said a new voice, male and brusque and impatient, &#x201c;for Chauncey McLaughlin.&#x201d;<br> <br>I reeled back toward the bed. It felt like Christmas morning, New Year&#x2019;s Eve, a birthday cake blazing with candles, a man down on one knee with a diamond ring in his hand. Joan was ABS&#x2019;s head of comedy, and Chauncey McLaughlin (rumor was, he&#x2019;d been born Chaim Melmann, then changed it to Charles, then gone full WASP with Chauncey) was the president of the network, a man I&#x2019;d glimpsed once at a holiday party and had spoken with precisely never. Chauncey McLaughlin was the man who ultimately decided which of the pilots would get shot and, of those, which would make it onto the air in the fall and which would die quietly in the springtime.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;ve I got?&#x201d; he asked in a booming voice. Names were reeled off&#x2014;Tariq, Lisa, Lloyd, Joan. &#x201c;And Ruth, of course.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; I managed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Chauncey McLaughlin. I don&#x2019;t want to keep you waiting. We&#x2019;re going to go ahead and shoot The Next Best Thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>I closed my eyes. My legs went watery with relief. &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; I said. With the phone still pressed to my ear, I got up and unlocked the bedroom door to find my grandmother standing there. Evidently she&#x2019;d given up even pretending that she wasn&#x2019;t waiting for the call. I flashed her a thumbs-up. She sprang into the air and actually clicked her heels together, a feat she couldn&#x2019;t have managed before her hip replacement two years before. Then she held my face in both of her hands. I could feel her hand on my left cheek and felt, as usual, nothing on my scarred right side as she kissed me, first on one cheek, then the other, before stowing her cell phone in her brassiere (&#x201c;God&#x2019;s pocket,&#x201d; she called it) and hurrying off to the kitchen, undoubtedly to start giving her hundred closest friends and relations the news. A moment later, Maurice appeared in the living-room doorway, dressed for golf, with his tanned hands clasped over his head. He stood on his tiptoes to kiss me&#x2014;Maurice, while not technically a little person, is a long way from tall, and a good six inches shorter than I am&#x2014;then turned back down the hallway. Maurice had two sons, no daughters, and even though he&#x2019;d never said so, my sense was that he liked having a young lady in his life. He&#x2019;d pull out my chair, hold doors open for me, ask me if my boyfriend was treating me well, and say that if he wasn&#x2019;t, he, Maurice, would be happy to talk to him about it.<br> <br>As congratulations spilled over the line, from Lisa and Tariq and Chauncey, I found myself wishing not for my boyfriend, Gary, but for Dave. Dave, one of the Two Daves, was my boss and my mentor, the one who&#x2019;d helped me craft the concept for The Next Best Thing, who&#x2019;d overseen each revision of the script and assured me that I had just as good a shot at writing my own show as any other writer in Hollywood, even if I&#x2019;d never been a staff writer, even if I was only twenty-eight.

Illuminating the paintings are an introduction by Eliza Rathbone and essays on the still-life tradition and the influence of Chardin. This handsome volume accompanies an exhibition at the Phillips Collection, Washington, D.C., and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.</p></p><p>Famous for outdoor scenes bathed in light, the impressionists are hard to imagine as dedicated still-life painters. By and large, they weren't. But Monet's rare small paintings of flowers were snapped up by contemporary collectors. And several artists who exhibited with the impressionists, influenced them, or were influenced by them--including Manet, van Gogh, Gauguin, and C�zanne--devoted a sizable portion of their oeuvre to the genre. While <i>Impressionist Still Life</i> is a somewhat misleading title--yet another marketing ploy to attract lovers of a popular style, it seems--this book makes a good case for the importance of this intimate genre of painting to major themes and techniques of later-19th-century art. Published in conjunction with an exhibition of the same name at the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C. (September 22, 2001, to January 13, 2002, then traveling to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), this volume is lavishly illustrated and rich in detailed information. Five essays trace themes ranging from the influence of 18th-century painter Jean-Baptiste Chardin on still-life composition and the use of color to the strikingly modern way C�zanne's famous apples devalued subject matter to emphasize the physicality of brush strokes. The stunning paintings featured in full-page plates include some rarely seen canvases, such as Monet's <i>Jar of Peaches</i> from 1866. In this tour de force of illusionism, the flattened look of peaches packed in a glass jar contrasts with fuzzy whole peaches that cast reflections on a marble table scribbled with bold white veins. A genre that could encompass both the luminous intimacy of Eva Gonzal�s' <i>White Shoes</i> and the restless drama of C�zanne's <i>Still Life with Ginger Jar and Eggplants</i> turned out to be uniquely suited to individual perceptions of modern life. <i>--Cathy Curtis</i>Exhibition Schedule: The Phillips Collection, Washington, D.C.: Sept. 22, 2001-Jan. 13,2002; The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston: Feb. 17, 2002-June 9, 2002 <br>Publicity: National publicity tie-in with Phillips Collection exhibition; National magazine and newspaper coverage <br>Advertising: Art magazines, regional booksellers' catalogues</p><h2>Fudge Cupcake Murder</h2><p>When bakery owner and occasional sleuth Hannah Swensen stumbles upon the body of Sheriff Grant behind the high school where she is teaching her cooking class, she must sift through dozens of clues and suspects to prove the innocence of the prime suspect, her brother-in-law Bill.

In Cold Blood, The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Slouching Towards Bethlehem, The Armies of the Night . . .</i><br>Starting in 1965 and spanning a ten-year period, a group of writers including Tom Wolfe, Jimmy Breslin, Gay Talese, Hunter S. Thompson, Joan Didion, John Sack, and Michael Herr emerged and joined a few of their pioneering elders, including Truman Capote and Norman Mailer, to remake American letters. The perfect chroniclers of an age of frenzied cultural change, they were blessed with the insight that traditional tools of reporting would prove inadequate to tell the story of a nation manically hopscotching from hope to doom and back again&#x2014;from war to rock, assassination to drugs, hippies to Yippies, Kennedy to the dark lord Nixon. Traditional just-the-facts reporting simply couldn&#x2019;t provide a neat and symmetrical order to this chaos.<br><br>Marc Weingarten has interviewed many of the major players to provide a startling behind-the-scenes account of the rise and fall of the most revolutionary literary outpouring of the postwar era, set against the backdrop of some of the most turbulent&#x2014;and significant&#x2014;years in contemporary American life. These are the stories behind those stories, from Tom Wolfe&#x2019;s white-suited adventures in the counterculture to Hunter S. Thompson&#x2019;s drug-addled invention of gonzo to Michael Herr&#x2019;s redefinition of war reporting in the hell of Vietnam. Weingarten also tells the deeper backstory, recounting the rich and surprising history of the editors and the magazines who made the movement possible, notably the three greatest editors of the era&#x2014;Harold Hayes at <i>Esquire</i>, Clay Felker at <i>New York</i>, and Jann Wenner at <i>Rolling Stone</i>. And finally Weingarten takes us through the demise of the New Journalists, a tragedy of hubris, miscalculation, and corporate menacing.<br><br>This is the story of perhaps the last great good time in American journalism, a time when writers didn&#x2019;t just cover stories but immersed themselves in them, and when journalism didn&#x2019;t just report America but reshaped it.<br><i>&#x201c;Within a seven-year period,</i> a group of writers emerged, seemingly out of nowhere&#x2014;Tom Wolfe, Jimmy Breslin, Gay Talese, Hunter S. Thompson, Joan Didion, John Sack, Michael Herr&#x2014;to impose some order on all of this American mayhem, each in his or her own distinctive manner (a few old hands, like Truman Capote and Norman Mailer, chipped in, as well). They came to tell us stories about ourselves in ways that we couldn&#x2019;t, stories about the way life was being lived in the sixties and seventies and what it all meant to us. The stakes were high; deep fissures were rending the social fabric, the world was out of order. So they became our master explainers, our town criers, even our moral conscience&#x2014;the New Journalists.&#x201d; <b><i>&#x2014;from the Introduction</i></b></p><p>Marc Weingarten&#x2019;s work has appeared in the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, the <i>New York Observer</i>, <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, <i>San Francisco</i>, and <i>Slate</i>. He lives in Los Angeles with his wife and two daughters.RADICAL LIT: SOME ROOTS OF A REVOLUTION<br><br> "New Journalism" is a slippery phrase. When Tom Wolfe made it the title of a 1973 anthology featuring pieces from such writers as Gay Talese, Hunter Thompson, Joan Didion, Norman Mailer, and others, he meant it to be a declaration of independence from any journalism that had preceded it. But there were others&#x2014;particularly the <i>New Yorker</i> crowd that had been stung by "Tiny Mummies"&#x2014;who criticized Wolfe for trying to trademark a technique that had existed for over two hundred years. They contended that there was nothing new about New Journalism.<br><br> They were both right. New Journalism had been flitting around the edges of American and British journalism since the earliest newspaper days. It was also true that writers such as Wolfe, Thompson, and Mailer didn't emerge fully formed from the empyrean. But had anyone ever really written like Wolfe, Thompson, or Mailer? No literary movement emerges from a vacuum, however, and here are some of the writers and movements that paved the way.<br><br> In his introduction to the 1973 anthology, Tom Wolfe makes a strong, self-serving argument for the literary supremacy of creative nonfiction over the novel, which he felt had suffered a precipitous status slippage.<br><br> He has little use for fiction writers like Jorge Luis Borges and Gabriel Garcia Marquez&#x2014;too enamored of myth, too "neo-fabulist." Modish experimental writers Donald Barthelme, John Hawkes, and John Barth, with their abstruse word games and dense allusiveness, were too busy with literary trickery to bother looking out of their own windows.<br><br> "In New York in the early 1960s," he writes, "what with all the talk of 'the death of the novel,' the man of letters seemed to be on the rise again. There was considerable talk of creating a 'cultural elite,' based on what the local literati believed existed in London. Such hopes were dashed, of course, by the sudden emergence of yet another horde of Visigoths, the New Journalists."<br><br> Wolfe compares his journalism contemporaries to eighteenth- and nineteenth-century giants Dickens, Balzac, and Fielding, writers who accurately portrayed their times in social realist fiction. The new fiction of the late sixties and seventies, with its inward turn away from the "hulking carnival" of contemporary American culture, left a huge void for New Journalists to fill.<br><br> Suffice it to say, Wolfe's theory had a few logical holes. There were novelists who were laying claim to the cultural landscape of America in some of the best postwar fiction&#x2014;Joseph Heller's <i>Catch-22</i> and James Baldwin's <i>Another Country</i>, for example. But Wolfe's contention that contemporary journalists were for the first time working up the literary hierarchy was true. They had come from a very long way down to do so.<br><br> Wolfe's notion of New Journalists as the new "Visigoths," a threat to the established order, stretches back to the earliest days of print media. Beginning with the Tudor era in fifteenth-century England, the British monarchy maintained an iron grip on the dissemination of public information. The history of journalism is in many ways a history of oppression and censorship. Countless government decrees in Great Britain&#x2014;the Privy Council's assumption of a censorship role, the suppression of the press by Oliver Cromwell in 1655&#x2014;forced newspapers underground. A black market emerged in the middle of the seventeenth century, as broadsheets that reported on specific news events were distributed clandestinely.<br><br> All of this iron-fisted regulation on the free exchange of ideas in the press created a thriving market for satire. Satirists could get away with more pointed protest than straight journalists, because they were moving targets who attacked with playful misdirection&#x2014;subversion as comic entertainment. Jonathan Swift, a Dubliner born to English parents, witnessed the corruption of English politics while apprenticing under Sir William Temple, an English diplomat and a retired member of the Irish parliament. In 1710, Swift became editor of the <i>Examiner</i>, which became the press organ of the Tory party. A fierce critic of the English government's dominion over Ireland, Swift wrote a series of impassioned broadsides condemning Great Britain's foreign policy. His 1729 essay "A Modest Proposal," which advocated eating Irish children as the best palliative for the country's overpopulation and food shortage, laid Ireland's abject poverty at the feet of the Brits, but disguised it as a mordantly funny satire:<br><br> There is likewise . . . great advantage in my scheme, that it will prevent those voluntary abortions, and that horrid practice of women murdering their bastard children, alas! too frequent among us! sacrificing the poor innocent babes I doubt more to avoid the expense than the shame, which would move tears and pity in the most savage and inhuman breast.<br><br> Two hundred and forty years prior to Hunter S. Thompson's gonzo journalism, Swift was practicing a particularly virulent kind of savagery in print, despite his close ties to the Catholic Church.<br><br> In 1836, twenty-one-year-old Charles Dickens was a parliamentary reporter for the British newspaper the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> when his editor, John Black, suggested that he focus less on matters of state and more on the streets of London. So Dickens ventured out, recording the mores of daily life among the working and middle classes. The result was a series of five articles called "Street Sketches," which became so popular that Dickens wrote forty-eight more sketches for the <i>Chronicle</i> and a rival paper, the<i> Evening Chronicle</i>.<br><br> Writing under the pseudonym Boz, Dickens created a series of modest portraits that captured ordinary working men and women&#x2014;bank clerks, shopkeepers, bakers, market men, laundresses&#x2014;who went about their business with little ceremony or ambition, the silent majority of a society that adhered closely to a rigid class code and had little use for the human flywheels of the industrial economy. Dickens's writing existed in a shadow region between speculative fiction and reportage, which gave Dickens the license to speculate on the inner lives of his characters with great specificity. Here, Dickens trains his focus on one such man, one of the "passive creatures of habit and endurance:"<br><br> We thought we almost saw the dingy little back office into which he walks every morning, hanging his hat on the same peg, and placing his legs beneath the same desk: first, taking off that black coat which lasts the year through, and putting on the one which did duty last year, and which he keeps in his desk to save the other. There he sits till five o'clock, working on, all day, as regularly as the dial over the mantel-piece, whose loud ticking is as monotonous as his whole existence: only raising his head when some one enters the counting-house, or when, in the midst of some difficult calculation, he looks up to the ceiling as if there were inspiration in the dusty skylight with a green knot in the centre of every pane of glass.<br><br> Here is a journalist filling in the blanks of his subject's life as he saw fit. The success of the Boz series would give creative license for other writers to do the same.<br><br> It's a stone fact that New Journalism emerged from the gutter, not only via reformist-minded writers with real concerns but also via exploiters who milked the class-based prejudices of the working class for every last drop of profit. The literary art of the scandal sheet can't be overlooked. Tom Wolfe has always regarded the best tabloid reporting as the apotheosis of New Journalism. It's where the high-beam writing style, the racy description and zippy dialogue, really ratcheted up to full throttle.<br><br> In the nineteenth century, the most clever and enterprising scandal monger was Joseph Pulitzer. A Hungarian immigrant who found work as a reporter for Carl Schurz's German-language weekly <i>Westliche Post </i> shortly after arriving in St Louis in 1868, Pulitzer quickly insinuated himself into the civic fabric of St. Louis despite his foreign heritage, becoming a member of the Missouri State Assembly in 1872. The next few years found Pulitzer reporting for Charles Dana's <i>New York Sun</i> (he covered the disputed presidential election between Rutherford Hayes and Samuel Tilden in 1876), traveling across Europe, and buying and selling shares in various newspapers. In 1878 Pulitzer brought the <i>St. Louis Evening Dispatch</i> out of receivership for $2,500 and merged it with the <i>Post</i>, which he had bought previously.<br><br> Pulitzer cast himself as a champion of the disenfranchised, offering his readers long investigative pieces that exposed the chicanery of St. Louis's venal robber barons, corrupt politicians, and other such villains of the industrial age. The <i>Post-Dispatch</i> ran stories that dug deeper, with more factual accuracy, than any other newspaper in the country. But the <i>Post-Dispatch</i> also trafficked freely in sensationalism, the better to keep its working-class readership entertained. Under the stewardship of managing editor John A. Cockerill, the <i>Post-Dispatch</i> ran scurrilous gossip items on the city's prominent social families as well as breathless accounts of grisly murder, adulterous sex, and public hangings. Within four years, the <i>Post-Dispatch</i> was the leading paper in St. Louis.<br><br> Pulitzer brought his serious reporting and tawdry gossip to New York in 1883, when he bought the <i>New York World</i> from financier Jay Gould for $346,000. The competition was much stiffer in New York, where the <i>Sun</i>, the<i> Herald</i>...</p><h2>The Complete Adventures of Charlie and Mr.Willy Wonka &#39;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&#39;,&#39;Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator</h2><p>&#34;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&#34; and &#34;Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator&#34; are there together in this single bumper volume.

Sent to an elite military academy at the tender age of four, Sergei Ivanov (Socrates) comes of age training to protect a way of life he doesn't understand. When a sudden death forces Sergei to flee, he escapes into the wilderness.</p><p>With nothing to cling to but a memory of his grandfather and the promise of a gift buried near St. Petersburg, Sergei journeys across a harsh land to seek his place in the world. The adventure that unfolds is not about the revolutions of history, but about the revolution in one man's heart. A stirring story of tragedy and triumph emerges as Sergei encounters mentors and masters who reveal secrets about the arts of war and, ultimately, the path to peace. From the heights of love to the depths of despair, from the threat of a mortal enemy to the search for a child he has never met, Sergei Ivanov's odyssey unlocks hidden wisdom at the heart of life. He could never have imagined that from the moment of his birth he was destined to become the peaceful warrior who would change the lives of millions worldwide.</p></p><p>Over the years, since publication of my best-known and bestselling book, <i>Way of the Peaceful Warrior</i>, numerous readers, curious about my old mentor, the man I called Socrates, asked me whether he was ever married or had children, and who were his teachers.&nbsp; This question of lineage has always seemed important to me.&nbsp; Teachers, guides, and wisdom-bearers and sharers rarely emerge fully-developed at birth (although many claim so).&nbsp; We each stand on the shoulders of others, and often wisdom is hard-earned.<br><br>I decided to share the story of the life of my old mentor -- this was the first impulse that eventually, after four years of intensive literary labor, would become <i>The Journeys of Socrates</i>. And on a personal level, I liked the challenge -- I wanted to stretch and test myself, to see if I could write a quality story that would engross and even move readers to deep emotion. As Herman Melville wrote, "Two write a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme."<br><br>Knowing a story and telling it are two different things. The theme that took shape in the writing summarizes, in a way, the course of the book:&nbsp; "How a boy became a man; how a man became a warrior; and (most important), how a warrior found peace."&nbsp; I didn't know it would become an archetypal story of conflict resolution -- a way to end the cycles of revenge and retribution (no matter how apparently justified) that plague our world today.&nbsp; This is a story about love, family, trauma, courage, and the tempering of a man's wisdom and spirit -- the making of a peaceful warrior.<p>Dan Millman is a former world champion gymnast, college professor, and martial arts instructor.

Less than three weeks before, on 22 June Hitler had unleashed his Wehrmacht's [Armed Forces] massive invasion of the Soviet Union code-named Operation Barbarossa, which sought to defeat the Soviet Union's Red Army, conquer the country, and unseat its Communist ruler, Josef Stalin. Between 22 June and 10 July, the Wehrmacht advanced up to 500 kilometers into Soviet territory, killed or captured up to one million Red Army soldiers, and reached the western banks of the Western Dvina and Dnepr Rivers, by doing so satisfying the premier assumption of Plan Barbarossa that the Third Reich would emerge victorious if it could defeat and destroy the bulk of the Red Army before it withdrew to safely behind those two rivers. With the Red Army now shattered, Hitler and most Germans expected total victory in a matter of weeks. <br><br>The ensuing battles in the Smolensk region frustrated German hopes for quick victory. Once across the Dvina and Dnepr Rivers, a surprised Wehrmacht encountered five fresh Soviet armies. Despite destroying two of these armies outright, severely damaging two others, and encircling the remnants of three of these armies in the Smolensk region, quick victory eluded the Germans. Instead, Soviet forces encircled in Mogilev and Smolensk stubbornly refused to surrender, and while they fought on, during July, August, and into early September, first five and then a total of seven newly-mobilized Soviet armies struck back viciously at the advancing Germans, conducting multiple counterattacks and counterstrokes, capped by two major counteroffensives that sapped German strength and will. Despite immense losses in men and materiel, these desperate Soviet actions derailed Operation Barbarossa. Smarting from countless wounds inflicted on his vaunted Wehrmacht, even before the fighting ended in the Smolensk region, Hitler postponed his march on Moscow and instead turned his forces southward to engage "softer targets" in the Kiev region. The 'derailment" of the Wehrmacht at Smolensk ultimately became the crucial turning point in Operation Barbarossa. <br><br>This groundbreaking new study, now significantly expanded, exploits a wealth of Soviet and German archival materials, including the combat orders and operational of the German OKW, OKH, army groups, and armies and of the Soviet Stavka, the Red Army General Staff, the Western Main Direction Command, the Western, Central, Reserve, and Briansk Fronts, and their subordinate armies to present a detailed mosaic and definitive account of what took place, why, and how during the prolonged and complex battles in the Smolensk region from 10 July through 10 September 1941. The structure of the study is designed specifically to appeal to both general readers and specialists by a detailed two-volume chronological narrative of the course of operations, accompanied by a third volume, and perhaps a fourth, containing archival maps and an extensive collection of specific orders and reports translated verbatim from Russian. The maps, archival and archival-based, detail every stage of the battle.<br><br>Within the context of Guderian's southward march toward the Kiev region, volume 2 in this series describes in unprecedented detail the Red Army's attempts to thwart German offensive plans by defeating Army Group Center in the Smolensk region with a general counteroffensive by three Red Army fronts. This volume restores to the pages of history two major military operations which, for political and military reasons, Soviet historians concealed from view, largely because both offensives failed. This volume includes: The Northern Flank: Group Stumme's (Third Panzer Group) Advance to Velikie Luki, Toropets, and Zapadnaia Dvina, 22 August-9 September 1941; German Strategic Planning, the Tilt toward Kiev, and Second Panzer Group's Advance Across the Desna River, 22-28 August 1941; The Third Soviet Counteroffensive, including the Western Front's Dukhovshchina Offensive, 26 August-6 September1941, the Reserve Front's El'nia Offensive, 30 August-10 September 1941, and the Briansk Front's Roslavl'-Novozybkov Offensive, 29 August-14 September 1941.<br><br>Based on the analysis of the vast mass of documentary materials exploited by this study, David Glantz presents a number of important new findings, notably: Soviet resistance to Army Group Center's advance into the Smolensk region was far stronger and more active than the Germans anticipated and historians have previously described; The military strategy Stalin, the Stavka, and Western Main Direction Command pursued was far more sophisticated than previously believed; Stalin, the Stavka, and Timoshenko's Western Main Direction Command employed a strategy of attrition designed to weaken advancing German forces; This attrition strategy inflicted far greater damage on Army Group Center than previously thought and, ultimately, contributed significantly to the Western and Kalinin Fronts' victories over Army Group Center in December 1941. <br><br>Quite simply, this series breaks new ground in World War II Eastern Front and Soviet military studies.</p><p>David M. Glantz (born 11 January 1942 in Port Chester, New York) is an American military historian and the editor of The Journal of Slavic Military Studies. Glantz received degrees in history from the Virginia Military Institute and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and is a graduate of the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, Defense Language Institute, Institute for Russian and Eastern European Studies, and U.S. Army War College. He entered active service with the United States Army in 1963. He began his military career in 1963 as a field artillery officer from 1965 to 1969, and served in various assignments in the United States, and in Vietnam during the Vietnam War with the II Field Force Fire Support Coordination Element (FSCE) at the Plantation in Long Binh. After teaching history at the United States Military Academy from 1969 through 1973, he completed the army&#x2019;s Soviet foreign area specialist program and became chief of Estimates in US Army Europe&#x2019;s Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence (USAREUR ODCSI) from 1977 to 1979. Upon his return to the United States in 1979, he became chief of research at the Army&#x2019;s newly-formed Combat Studies Institute (CSI) at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, from 1979 to 1983 and then Director of Soviet Army Operations at the Center for Land Warfare, U.S. Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, from 1983 to 1986. While at the College, Col. Glantz was instrumental in conducting the annual "Art of War" symposia which produced the best analysis of the conduct of operations on the Eastern Front during the Second World War in English to date. The symposia included attendance of a number of former German participants in the operations, and resulted in publication of the seminal transcripts of proceedings. Returning to Fort Leavenworth in 1986, he helped found and later directed the U.S. Army&#x2019;s Soviet (later Foreign) Military Studies Office (FMSO), where he remained until his retirement in 1993 with the rank of Colonel. In 1993, while at FMSO, he established The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, a scholarly journal for which he still serves as chief editor, that covers military affairs in the states of Central and Eastern Europe as well as the former Soviet Union. A member of the Russian Federation&#x2019;s Academy of Natural Sciences, he has written or co-authored more than twenty commercially published books, over sixty self-published studies and atlases, and over one hundred articles dealing with the history of the Red (Soviet) Army, Soviet military strategy, operational art, and tactics, Soviet airborne operations, intelligence, and deception, and other topics related to World War II. In recognition of his work, he has received several awards, including the Society of Military History&#x2019;s prestigious Samuel Eliot Morrison Prize for his contributions to the study of military history. Glantz is regarded by many as one of the best western military historians of the Soviet role in World War II.[1] He is perhaps most associated with the thesis that World War II Soviet military history has been prejudiced in the West by its over-reliance on German oral and printed sources, without being balanced by a similar examination of Soviet source material. A more complete version of this thesis can be found in his paper &#x201c;The Failures of Historiography: Forgotten Battles of the German-Soviet War (1941-1945).&#x201d; [2] Despite his acknowledged expertise, Glantz has occasionally been criticized for his stylistic choices, such as inventing specific thoughts and feelings of historical figures without reference to documented sources.[3] Glantz is also known as an opponent of Viktor Suvorov's thesis, which he endeavored to rebut with the book Stumbling Colossus. He lives with his wife Mary Ann Glantz in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. The Glantzes' daughter Mary E. Glantz, also a historian, has written FDR And The Soviet Union: The President's Battles Over Forei"This is operational history at its best, meticulously researched and presented for the reader to analyze."

Thacker, Dept of History, Western Kentucky University in the Bowling Green Daily News)<br><br>"...such a thorough and scrupulous account of these battles is long overdue. By closely examining these early battles, the author shows how the weakened Soviet military leadership studied their early mistakes, regained their balance, and struck back with deadly fury. Though the Soviet nightmare was to last for another four long years, the painful lessons learned on the battlefields in and around Smolensk during the summer of 1941 were the key to the ultimate Soviet victory."

Cleaver allows that talent is needed to win a National Book Award, say, but otherwise, any of us can do it. All we need is the ability to "develop and exercise sadistic license." The operative word is <i>conflict</i>. As Cleaver puts it, "Happy lives make lousy novels.... If the characters are having a good time, the reader is not." He takes the mystery out of fiction writing. You don't have to write about what you know, he says; write what you can imagine. Don't fret if you can't find large chunks of time to write. Start with five minutes on weekdays and 20 on weekends, and you'll have 100 to 300 pages by year's end. Perhaps most refreshing about Cleaver's approach is the lack of directives. Some writing instructors demand that you work with an outline; others forbid it.

Here are tasty soups for every appetite and every season. Cold-weather comfort is as close as Abruzzi Chickpea and Chestnut Soup. And casual warm-weather lunches and suppers are more tempting with a tureen of Zuppa di Primavera (&#34;soup of springtime&#34;). And for anytime: Five-Fish Soup from Livorno or Garlicky Mussels in Broth.</p><p>After a zealous soup quest across the length and breadth of Italy, Joe Famularo presents 150 Italian soups for every occasion and mood. There are soups to start a meal and soups to make a meal. Humble soups, born of necessity during leaner times, and the inventive soups of professional chefs. Seasonal soups, regional soups, family soups. Vegetable soups and pasta soups, fish soups and meat soups, bean soups and rice soups.<p> But behind the great variety of soups are the qualities found in all true Italian cooking-simplicity, integrity, ingenuity, and the use of only the best ingredients. A fat bunch of spring's first asparagus, lightly cooked and then added to a broth of arborio rice, creates an incomparable Sauteed Asparagus Soup. Glistening fresh fish, angel hair pasta, and two handfuls of peas, is transformed into minestra di pesce con piselli e capelli d'angelo-a dazzling fish soup from Liguria on the Italian Riviera.</p><p> Other soups, like the minestrones, reveal yet another side of Italian cuisine-its marvelous regional character. In mountainous Abruzzi, pork is used as a flavor base while fresh fennel and mint make it indescribably lush. Romans, meanwhile, favor a minestrone founded on beef and beef broth, red beans and red wine. The Milanese add rice to theirs, the Genovese pesto and pasta, and the Calabrians give an unexpected flourish to a tomato- and garlic-based minestrone with a shower of slivered yellow peppers.</p><p> Delicious, naturally healthy, and with a depth of flavor that satisfies right down to the bones, Italian soups nourish body and soul. And from basic brodo (broth) to meal-in-a-pot minestrone, Joe Famularo serves them up. </p><p></p>ONE OF THE BEST KEPT SECRETS OF ITALY IS SOUP . . . and Joe Famularo knows it.

But shortly after Dupre found himself alone after a twenty-year marriage, he decided he needed to summit Denali, the continent&#x2019;s tallest mountain, alone and in the harshest possible conditions to prove something to himself. <br><br> Dupre was on his fourth attempt in five years in late December 2014 when a surprise storm caught him at 11,200 feet. Forced to live for almost five full days with little food and water, Dupre was in the most dangerous situation of his life.<br><em>Alone at the Top</em> offers a mountaineer&#x2019;s firsthand perspective during life-and-death decision making on the mountain. Dupre takes readers along with him as he struggles to keep his mind and body in shape while facing incredible hardships. He applies the lessons learned on the mountain to everyday life.</p><p><strong>Lonnie Dupre</strong> has spent most of his adult life either traveling in the Arctic or planning his next trip there. Dupre's significant achievements include the world's first circumnavigation of Greenland and a summer expedition to the North Pole. During his travels over the Arctic's disappearing ice, Dupre has participated in both scientific research and cultural exchanges, working with and gathering data for organizations such as the National Geographic Society, Greenpeace, the Explorers Club, the National Snow and Ice Data Center, and the U.S. Department of Atmospheric Sciences. His findings have been called "the Holy Grail of global warming data." Dupre lives on the shores of Lake Superior in Grand Marais, Minnesota.<br><br><strong>Pam Louwagie</strong> is an award-winning reporter at the <em>Minneapolis Star Tribune</em>.

Louwagie lives in Minneapolis.&#x201c;Among the small subset of climbers who have survived Denali in winter, Lonnie Dupre is the exemplar of tenacity. It&#x2019;s not just that he soloed North America&#x2019;s highest and coldest alp in January at age fifty-three, but as described in this inspirational book, he came back repeatedly, four winters in a row, failure after failure, until he finally summited.&#x201d;<br><strong>Jon Waterman</strong>, author of <em>In the Shadow of Denali and High Alaska</em><br>&#x201c;Lonnie&#x2019;s vivid account in<em>Alone at the Top</em> threw me back to my ascent of North America&#x2019;s magnificent giant. . . . This powerful story brings the reader along on each labored step and racing thought. Determined and tenacious, yet willing to learn and adjust well-laid plans&#x2015;Lonnie offers lessons for us all.&#x201d;<br><strong>Ann Bancroft</strong>, first woman to reach both the North and South Poles, and author of <em>No Horizon Is So Far</em><br>&#x201c;<em>Alone at the Top</em> speaks to Lonnie Dupre&#x2019;s persistence and lifelong commitment to expeditions and adventure. I was very relieved when Lonnie completed his epic climb of Denali.&#x201d;<br><strong>Will Steger</strong>, arctic explorer and author of <em>North to the Pole</em><br>&#x201c;<em>Alone at the Top</em> is an amazing account by a man driven by determination and grit to make a solo ascent of Denali in winter. After three failed attempts, Lonnie Dupre finally reached his goal by standing on the summit of North America&#x2019;s highest peak on January 11, 2015, illuminated by the feeble afternoon winter sun. One can learn many great lessons from Dupre about setting a goal, never giving up, and knowing that being uncomfortable is the price you pay for the sake of success.&#x201d;<br><strong>Ed Viesturs</strong>, author of <em>No Shortcuts to the Top</em></p><h2>The Men Who Stare at Goats</h2><p>In 1979 a secret unit was established by the most gifted minds within the U.S. Army. Defying all known accepted military practice -- and indeed, the laws of physics -- they believed that a soldier could adopt a cloak of invisibility, pass cleanly through walls, and, perhaps most chillingly, kill goats just by staring at them.<p>Entrusted with defending America from all known adversaries, they were the First Earth Battalion. And they really weren't joking. What's more, they're back and fighting the War on Terror. </p><p> With firsthand access to the leading players in the story, Ronson traces the evolution of these bizarre activities over the past three decades and shows how they are alive today within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and in postwar Iraq. Why are they blasting Iraqi prisoners of war with the theme tune to Barney the Purple Dinosaur? Why have 100 debleated goats been secretly placed inside the Special Forces Command Center at Fort Bragg, North Carolina? How was the U.S. military associated with the mysterious mass suicide of a strange cult from San Diego? <i>The Men Who Stare at Goats</i> answers these and many more questions.</p><p>Ronson's <i>Them: Adventures with Extremists,</i> a highly acclaimed international bestseller, examined the paranoia at the fringes of hate-filled extremist movements around the globe. <i>The Men Who Stare at Goats</i> reveals extraordinary and very nutty military secrets at the core of George W. Bush's War on Terror.</p></p><p>Just when you thought every possible conspiracy theory had been exhausted by <i>The X-Files</i> or <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>, along comes <i>The Men Who Stare at Goats</i>. The first line of the book is, "This is a true story." True or not, it is quite astonishing. Author Jon Ronson writes a column about family life for London's <i>Guardian</i> newspaper and has made several acclaimed documentaries. <i>The Men Who Stare at Goats</i> is his bizarre quest into "the most whacked-out corners of George W. Bush's War on Terror," as he puts it. Ronson is inspired when a man who claims to be a former U.S. military psychic spy tells the journalist he has been reactivated following the 9-11 attack. Ronson decides to investigate. His research leads him to the U.S. Army's strange forays into extra-sensory perception and telepathy, which apparently included efforts to kill barnyard animals with nothing more than thought. Ronson meets one ex-Army employee who claims to have killed a goat and his pet hamster by staring at them for prolonged periods of time. Like Ronson's original source, this man also says he has been reactivated for deployment to the Middle East. <p> Ronson's finely written book strikes a perfect balance between curiosity, incredulity, and humor. His characters are each more bizarre than the last, and Ronson does a wonderful job of depicting the colorful quirks they reveal in their often-comical meetings. Through a charming guile, he manages to elicit many strange and amazing revelations. Ronson meets a general who is frustrated in his frequent attempts to walk through walls. One source says the U.S. military has deployed psychic assassins to the Middle East to hunt down Al Qaeda suspects.

They are so twangingly attuned to their era and to each other that they can go on being extremely funny almost indefinitely.&#34; -Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., from the Foreword After twenty-nine years of making America laugh by way of radio, television and the theater, here, in glorious triumph, are Bob and Ray, &#34;those two extraordinarily creative and hilariously witty men&#34; (Alec Wilder), in their first book. Bob and Ray were an American comedy duo whose career spanned five decades. Composed of comedians Bob Elliott (1923-2016) and Ray Goulding (1922-1990), the duo&#39;s format was typically to satirize the medium in which they were performing, such as conducting radio or television interviews, with off-the-wall dialogue presented in a generally deadpan style as though it was a serious broadcast. From the first memorable radio appearances in Boston and New York, to their television shows, to their inspired commercials, to their uproarious Broadway show, here are dozens of their very best pieces, which, as the Wall Street Journal said of them on Broadway, &#34;gently, relentlessly, hilariously pierce the protective armor of just about every red-blooded American type you can think of.&#34; Within these pages, embellished with photographs and cariactures, are such classics as Mary Backstayge, Noble Wife; Emer W. Litzinger, Spy; Prodigy Street (featuring Mr. Wise Old Owl andWally, theWord Man); and the amazing Mr. Science (&#34;You wouldn&#39;t try to slip me the old rubber peach just because I&#39;m a gullible child, would you, Mr.Science?&#34;). Not to mention visits with such notable gentlemen as Bert and Harry Piel, Lawrence Fechtenberger, and the redoubtable Tippy, the Wonder Dog. Pick up their book, open it and enjoy - welcome to the incomparable world of &#34;the last true gentlemen of comedy,&#34; Bob and Ray.</p><p></p><h2>King of Kings</h2><p>Dust jacket art by Paul Bacon. A novel of the life of David.</p><p></p><h2>I&#39;m No Hero: A POW Story</h2><p>I&#39;m No Hero is the autobiography of Captain J. Charles Plumb. It is also the detailed story of American POW&#39;s in Viet Nam who faced an isolated world of degradation, loneliness, tedium, hunger and pain. More significantly, it is a story of hope for it deals directly with the techniques used by the POW&#39;s to survive, and how those same techniques can be used by each of us to overcome the riggers of everyday life. The story is not pretty. It tells of illness, of insanity, of the torture room with walls built to muffle human screams, of the &#34;rope trick&#34; and the &#34;fan belt&#34; - torture procedures designed to make a man talk. But it also tells of the ingenuity and creativity which allowed the men to outsmart their guards, to set up communication systems, educational classes, escape plans, and to maintain their chain of command. It is a revealing story of hope, validating the strength of the human spirit. Plumb is a living testimony to how overcoming adversity can propel us beyond self-imposed limits, making us stronger and more confident. He leaves his readers wanting to achieve and excel, no matter what the obstacles.</p><p></p><h2>Love Not a Rebel</h2><p>Amanda Sterling is forced to become a Tory spy when the Revolutionary War breaks out, but the subject of her attention, Lord Eric Cameron, is equally crafty, feeding her false information and capturing her heart</p><p><i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA Today</i> bestselling author <b>Heather Graham</b> majored in theater arts at the University of South Florida. Her first book was published by Dell, and since then she has written more than one hundred novels and novellas. Married since high school graduation and the mother of five, Graham asserts that her greatest love in life remains her family, but she also believes that her career has been an incredible gift. Romance Writers of America presented Heather Graham with the RWA Lifetime Achievement Award in 2003.The third installment in Graham's North American Woman series ( Sweet Savage Eden ) is the best, reclaiming the familiar landscape of Revolutionary America. Eric Cameron, a rebel general, desires and eventually marries beautiful Tory Amanda Sterling even though he realizes that she spies for the British. What he does not know, however, is that blackmail has forced Amanda into espionage. The multiple misunderstandings driving the plot are developed adroitly, with the single exception of a complication involving Amanda's father, whose cruelty to her eventually is explained through a flimsy deus ex machina resolution. Graham adds a few historical figures to her cast but these portrayals (of Benjamin Franklin and George Washington) are superficial. In developing the romance element, however, Graham never falters. The bold sensuality and frankness of her descriptions convey both the physical pleasure and emotional transport of erotic love. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Goya</h2><p>Part of the series &#34;The Library of Great Painters.&#34; With 127 illustrations, including 48 tipped-in colorplates.</p><p>This paperback edition of the award-winning study of the life and work of Goya is filled with the same fine reproductions as the original 1994 hardcover. Goya was one of Spain's greatest and most controversial painters, famous for incisive portraits and the "black" paintings of his later years. Scholars have often attributed Goya's progression from producing light-hearted court paintings to creating somber images of the Napoleonic wars to the artist's serious illness of 1792, which left him deaf. Writer Janis Tomlinson's aim here is to show a continuity in his work before and after the illness. She sees in Goya's vast output--at least 1,800 works--a vital drive to explore and exploit his personal creativity, which was strengthened by the deafness that cut him off from all but visual communication with the world. With detail supported by formidable research, Tomlinson presents Goya's life chronologically, analyzing his work from icons like the <i>Naked Maya</i> to his <i>Los Caprichos</i> series of etchings with their biting social satire and supernatural imaginings of a world turned upside down. The demonic intensity of <i>Saturn Devouring His Son</i> and <i>Witches Sabbath</i>, painted on the walls of his "Country House of a Deaf Man" at the end of his life, suggest to some the work of an embittered madman. Rather, these disturbing paintings reflect Goya's profound empathy for the victims of a predatory and unjust society--empathy that a modern audience readily shares. <i>--John Stevenson</i>Goya is sometimes called the last of the Old Masters and the first of the Moderns, and his work has left a lasting impression on avant garde artists from Manet to Picasso. This paperback volume offers an introduction to Goya and covers all aspects of his work: oil, fresco, etching, lithography, chalk and pen. In his lifetime, Goya worked for some of the most prestigious Spanish patrons. For most of his career he was court painter, and yet he also produced some of the most compelling images of social unrest of the last century. The book opens with an introduction to the artistic milieu in Saragossa, where Goya received his earliest training. It moves on to explain the growth of his career in Madrid where he eventually became the most prominent painter at court before and after the French occupation of his country. Throughout the text, Goya&#39;s work is set in its political and social context. The work ends with a discussion of his influence on such artists as Manet, Ensor and Picasso.</p><h2>Sages and Dreamers: Biblical, Talmudic, and Hasidic Portraits and Legends</h2><p>Twenty-five portraits of figures from the Jewish tradition explore the mysteries of Jewish existence and themes of humility, silence, loyalty, and truth, and feature Esther, Noah, Daniel, Ruth, and others</p><p>Reflections by the Nobel-winning philosopher and novelist on the prophets, scribes, and rebbes who comprise the histories and myths of Jewish folklore. Most of these essays were originally given as lectures at the 92nd Street Y in New York, and even in written form they preserve the tone and tempo of extemporary speech. The style is anecdotal rather than scholarly, and Wiesel does not hesitate to bring his opinions to bear (such as on the story of Jephthah, for instance, of which he declares, ``This story is...so frightening that I wish it could be erased from Scripture''). Such an approach is bound to have its drawbacks, and Wiesel's treatment of the Bible leaves much to be desired: It is to his credit that he examines it as a narrative of spiritually resonant stories rather than as a scholarly text, but he seems rather too anxious to draw particular conclusions (especially in regard to the paradox of suffering) from passages that do not necessarily support his view. His consideration of the Talmud is much more insightful, and his tales of the great Hasidic rebbes form the best part of the book: a fascinating mosaic of hagiography and legend. Behind all of these accounts is the tragic awareness, sometimes explicit but usually unspoken, of the catastrophe that would ultimately strike the Jews of Europe, a catastrophe that Wiesel himself witnessed and survived. His book provides clear testimony of the survival, not only of an individual soul but an entire history. Informative and moving: a rich collage. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

From abuse to addiction, the second novel, <i>Bad News</i> opens as the twenty-two-year-old Patrick sets off to collect his father's ashes from New York, where he will spend a drug-crazed twenty-four hours. And back in England, the third novel, <i>Some Hope</i>, offers a sober and clean Patrick the possibility of recovery. The fourth novel, the Booker-shortlisted <i>Mother's Milk</i>, returns to the family chateau, where Patrick, now married and a father himself, struggles with child rearing, adultery, his mother's desire for assisted suicide, and the loss of the family home to a New Age foundation.</p><p>Edward St. Aubyn offers a window into a world of utter decadence, amorality, greed, snobbery, and cruelty&#x2015;welcome to the declining British aristocracy.</p></p><p><b>Edward St. Aubyn</b> was born in London in 1960.

Her sandal made a faint slapping sound as she clenched her toes to prevent it from falling off, and its broken strap made her walk unsteadily over the stony, rutted ground. Over the wall, below the line of cypresses that ran along the edge of the drive, she saw the doctor standing in the garden.<br>In his blue dressing gown, and already wearing dark glasses although it was still too early for the September sun to have risen above the limestone mountain, he directed a heavy stream of water from the hose he held in his left hand onto the column of ants moving busily through the gravel at his feet. His technique was well established: he would let the survivors struggle over the wet stones, and regain their dignity for a while, before bringing the thundering water down on them again. With his free hand he removed a cigar from his mouth, its smoke drifting up through the brown and grey curls that covered the jutting bones of his forehead. He then narrowed the jet of water with his thumb to batter more effectively an ant on whose death he was wholly bent.<br>Yvette had only to pass the fig tree and she could slip into the house without Dr Melrose knowing she had arrived. His habit, though, was to call her without looking up from the ground just when she thought she was screened by the tree. Yesterday he had talked to her for long enough to exhaust her arms, but not for so long that she might drop the linen. He gauged such things very precisely. He had started by asking her opinion of the mistral, with exaggerated respect for her native knowledge of Provence. By the time he was kind enough to show an interest in her son&#x2019;s job at the shipyard, the pain had spread to her shoulders and started to make sharp forays into her neck. She had been determined to defy him, even when he asked about her husband&#x2019;s back pains and whether they might prevent him from driving the tractor during the harvest. Today he did not call out with the &#x2018;Bonjour, ch�re Yvette&#x2019; which inaugurated these solicitous morning chats, and she stooped under the low branches of the fig tree to enter the house.<br>The chateau, as Yvette called what the Melroses called an old farmhouse, was built on a slope so that the drive was level with the upper floor of the house. A wide flight of steps led down one side of the house to a terrace in front of the drawing room.<br>Another flight skirted the other side of the house down to a small chapel which was used to hide the dustbins. In winter, water gurgled down the slope through a series of pools, but the gutter which ran beside the fig tree was silent by this time of year, and clogged with squashed and broken figs that stained the ground where they had fallen.<br>Yvette walked into the high dark room and put down the laundry. She switched on the light and began to divide the towels from the sheets and the sheets from the tablecloths. There were ten tall cupboards piled high with neatly folded linen, none of it now used. Yvette sometimes opened these cupboards to admire this protected collection. Some of the tablecloths had laurel branches and bunches of grapes woven into them in a way that only showed when they were held at certain angles. She would run her finger over the monograms embroidered on the smooth white sheets, and over the coronets encircling the letter &#x2018;V&#x2019; in the corner of the napkins. Her favourite was the unicorn that stood over a ribbon of foreign words on some of the oldest sheets but these too were never used, and Mrs Melrose insisted that Yvette recycle the same poor pile of plain linen from the smaller cupboard by the door.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br>Eleanor Melrose stormed her way up the shallow steps from the kitchen to the drive. Had she walked more slowly, she might have tottered, stopped, and sat down in despair on the low wall that ran along the side of the steps. She felt defiantly sick in a way she dared not challenge with food and had already aggravated with a cigarette. She had brushed her teeth after vomiting but the bilious taste was still in her mouth. She had brushed her teeth before vomiting as well, never able to utterly crush the optimistic streak in her nature. The mornings had grown cooler since the beginning of September and the air already smelt of autumn, but this hardly mattered to Eleanor who was sweating through the thick layers of powder on her forehead. With each step she pushed her hands against her knees to help her forward, staring down through huge dark glasses at the white canvas shoes on her pale feet, her dark pink raw-silk trousers like hot peppers clinging to her legs.<br>She imagined vodka poured over ice and all the cubes that had been frosted turning clear and collapsing in the glass and the ice cracking, like a spine in the hands of a confident osteopath. All the sticky, awkward cubes of ice floating together, tinkling, their frost thrown off to the side of the glass, and the vodka cold and unctuous in her mouth.<br>The drive rose sharply to the left of the steps to a circle of flat ground where her maroon Buick was parked under an umbrella pine. It looked preposterous, stretched out on its white-walled tyres against the terraced vines and olive groves behind it, but to Eleanor her car was like a consulate in a strange city, and she moved towards it with the urgency of a robbed tourist.<br>Globules of translucent resin were stuck to the Buick&#x2019;s bonnet. One splash of resin with a dead pine needle inside it was glued to the base of the windscreen. She tried to pick it off, but only smeared the windscreen more and made the tips of her fingers sticky. She wanted to get into the car very much, but she went on scratching compulsively at the resin, blackening her fingernails. The reason that Eleanor liked her Buick so much was that David never drove it, or even sat in it. She owned the house and the land, she paid for the servants and the drink, but only this car was really in her possession.<br>When she had first met David twelve years ago, she had been fascinated by his looks. The expression that men feel entitled to wear when they stare out of a cold English drawing room onto their own land had grown stubborn over five centuries and perfected itself in David&#x2019;s face. It was never quite clear to Eleanor why the English thought it was so distinguished to have done nothing for a long time in the same place, but David left her in no doubt that they did. He was also descended from Charles II through a prostitute. &#x2018;I&#x2019;d keep quiet about that, if I were you,&#x2019; she had joked when he first told her. Instead of smiling, he had turned his profile towards her in a way she had grown to loathe, thrusting out his underlip and looking as if he were exercising great tolerance by not saying something crushing.<br>There had been a time when she admired the way that David became a doctor. When he had told his father of his intention, General Melrose had immediately cut off his annuity, preferring to use the money to rear pheasants. Shooting men and animals were the occupations of a gentleman, tending their wounds the business of middle-class quacks. That was the General&#x2019;s view, and he was able to enjoy more shooting as a consequence of holding it. General Melrose did not find it difficult to treat his son coldly. The first time he had taken an interest in him was when David left Eton, and his father asked him what he wanted to do. David stammered, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m afraid I don&#x2019;t know, sir,&#x2019; not daring to admit that he wanted to compose music. It had not escaped the General&#x2019;s attention that his son fooled about on the piano, and he rightly judged that a career in the army would put a curb on this effeminate impulse. &#x2018;Better join the army,&#x2019; he said, offering his son a cigar with awkward camaraderie.<br>And yet, to Eleanor, David had seemed so different from the tribe of minor English snobs and distant cousins who hung around, ready for an emergency, or for a weekend, full of memories that were not even their own, memories of the way their grandfathers had lived, which was not in fact how their grandfathers had lived. When she had met David, she thought that he was the first person who really understood her. Now he was the last person she would go to for understanding. It was hard to explain this change and she tried to resist the temptation of thinking that he had been waiting all along for her money to subsidize his fantasies of how he deserved to live. Perhaps, on the contrary, it was her money that had cheapened him. He had stopped his medical practice soon after their marriage. At the beginning, there had been talk of using some of her money to start a home for alcoholics. In a sense they had succeeded.<br>The thought of running into David struck Eleanor again. She tore herself away from the pine resin on the windscreen, clambered into the car and drove the unwieldy Buick past the steps and along the dusty drive, only stopping when she was halfway down the hill. She was on her way over to Victor Eisen&#x2019;s so she could make an early start for the airport with Anne, but first she had to straighten herself out. Folded in a cushion under the driver&#x2019;s seat was a half-bottle of Bisquit brandy. In her bag she had the yellow pills for keeping her alert and the white ones for taking away the dread and panic that alertness brought with it. With the long drive ahead of her she took four instead of two of the yellow pills and then, worrying that the double dose might make her jumpy, she took two of the white ones, and drank about half the bottle of brandy to help the pills down. At first she shuddered violently, and then before it even reached her bloodstream, she felt the sharp click of alcohol, filling her with gratitude and warmth.<br>She subsided into the seat on which she had only been perched, recognizing herself in the mirror for the first time that day. She settled into her body, like a sleepwalker who climbs back into bed...</p><h2>The Woman Who Married a Bear</h2><p>In Sitka, Alaska, the bizarre death of a big-game hunter years before is investigated by investigator Cecil Younger, who uncovers a many-layered mystery involving the folklore and mythology of the local Tlingit Indians.</p><p>John Straley lives in Alaska with his small son and his wife, a marine biolog1<br> SITKA, ALASKA, OCTOBER<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My head is a cup left out</i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on a stormy autumn night;</i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; half full of water, and a spider.<br><br></i> I had botched my seventeen syllables, my money was gone, and my only credit card was missing. The worst of it was I didn&#x2019;t remember if it was stolen or given away. I sat on the green bench in front of the Pioneer Home with my wallet sitting in my hand, as useless as a ticket for a ferry I had just missed. I felt like I had a spider digging into my inner ear, and a fur-bearing animal trying to claw its way out of my stomach. This was the beginning of an extraordinarily bad day. Even if it wasn&#x2019;t raining.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#x2019;ve tried other hangover cures besides haiku. Once, I had grabbed the back of the radio that was chained to the bed of my hotel room in Rock Springs, Wyoming, hoping, as the voice said, that &#x201c;the blessed power of Jesus&#x201d; would fill my soul. Besides a brief jolt of 110&#x2014;nothing. I&#x2019;ve tried reading poetry in hopes that the sludge of alcohol would melt into the atmosphere. This morning I had found a book by Wendell Berry flopping in the bottom of my bed like a cold hot-water bottle. The woman who used to love me left it on my bedside table before leaving me. I had thrown it in my pocket before going out. Tempting fate. But no jolt of clarity came; I never got past the inscription. In green ink she had written, &#x201c;There is nowhere to stand but in absence, no life but in the fateful light.&#x201d; She was cute, and now a Christian. Her skin was as white as a sea anemone, and as soft as the pool of warm air you pass through while rowing across the bay. I didn&#x2019;t know why in the hell she had written that.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once, I&#x2019;d thought that I could cure a hangover by swimming in the cold water off my house. I&#x2019;d eased my body into the Pacific Ocean that joins the Gulf of Alaska just past the channel: numbness, and needles of pain, like remembering and forgetting all at once. Going into the ocean, my feet, my legs, my testicles; it seemed like such a tight fit.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I broke off a piece of bread from a two-day-old sandwich that was tucked into my windbreaker and flipped it onto the cement sidewalk. The raven watching me dropped into a crowd of plump pigeons and snatched it away. A large black bird with a gently curving beak, he sat on the back of my bench, cackling like a fiend. I looked at him carefully and noticed he had a loop of red thread hooked around his left leg. Maybe someone had tried to snare him: a kid with a long stick and a mound of bait, waiting, waiting for the bird to drop and then losing him as soon as the slack was pulled. Raven the trickster: the missing piece of darkness.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Pioneer Home is an old folks&#x2019; home run by the state of Alaska. I had an appointment to see one of the residents but I was sitting outside killing time while they carefully made their way around their breakfast. I thought of their bran cereal and coffee. I thought of the brass ship&#x2019;s clock that ticks loudly and unheard in the corner. I had about ten minutes.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I flipped a piece of cheese to the raven and tried to run down last night&#x2019;s events. I remembered bumping into Wynton Duarte. Wynton is an unsuccessful drug dealer and decent storyteller, but yesterday he was taking and not giving. There is a parity that must be maintained with people who tell stories for a living and Wynton had wanted to know the story about a particular police informant who was rumored to be in town.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The home looks like a stately old seaside hotel. It&#x2019;s bordered by flower gardens and lawns that sit in the middle of town across from the post office. The post office is the center of the community where most of the eight thousand people in Sitka still come to pick up their mail. Next to it is the hill where the official transfer of Alaska from Russia to the United States took place and where Alexander Baranof, the manager of the Russian American Company, built his first leaky-roofed cabin. A stone wall borders the lawns of the home. It runs at waist height along the two main streets that meet in the corner at the center of town. Katlian is named for the Tlingit warrior who almost whipped the Russian thugs with a blacksmith&#x2019;s hammer, the other is named for Abraham Lincoln.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#x2019;s on this wall that many of Sitka&#x2019;s pink-cheeked youths, including Wynton Duarte, sit and drink rum and smoke reefer, plotting their many small and unobtrusive crimes. When a tour ship comes in to dump hundreds of rain-jacketed, camera-laden tourists, the youths are encouraged by the friendly small-town police officers to recreate elsewhere. Often, they will move their parties up into one of the deserted Russian cemeteries, drinking rum and listening to chainsaw guitar riffs from their tape players. They sit on the overturned gravestones in the dense forest, their music drifting into town like the sound of machinery from a clear cut.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#x2019;d been drinking for a while, maybe days, but last night I&#x2019;d found myself with Duarte and some guys off a black cod boat sitting on the wall drinking apple wine mixed with grain alcohol, and after several drinks it occurred to someone that we all should go to a restaurant and eat some pizza and drink some Mexican beer that I could charge on my credit card. Of the rest of the evening I have mostly an impressionistic collage. Floating in the foreground is a leather-clad singer who reminded me of Marlene Dietrich in <i>The Blue Angel, </i>her tone searing through the fog, like the whine of an outboard. I remember the fo&#x2019;c&#x2019;sle of a halibut schooner, tequila, a woman changing her shirt and talking about a horse in Montana, someone crying and some vague talk about a gun.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I woke up, in my own bed, there was blood on my sleeve. From the feel of my nose, the blood might have been mine. Duarte, my money and my charge card were among the missing. I listened to a message on my answering machine telling me to come to the Pioneer Home to speak to Mrs. Victor. I could tell as she spoke that she was serious. There was a percussive melody in her voice as if she had learned to speak from the raven. She was insistent: I needed to speak to her this morning.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard people shuffling out of the dining hall in the home. I shook the crumbs out of my pocket and then jammed the last part of the sandwich back in. There was a woman in peach-colored slacks standing in the middle of the street trying to watch for traffic and take a picture of the Russian Orthodox Cathedral at the same time. This involved a lot of head bobbing and hand waving from her husband on the sidewalk. A raven was the only one sitting on the wall now. A slight breeze off the harbor ruffled his feathers, and as he watched he made noises deep in his throat that sounded like stones dropping into a well. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tourist lady fussed with her hair and looked nervously up and down the street, even though there were no cars in sight this Sunday morning. She snapped the shot, scurried to her husband, and the raven flew to the curb in front of a bar where he began to eat what looked like the remnants of a pickled egg.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked up the steps of the home and in through the double doors. I had left the book by Wendell Berry on the bench outside. No one steals books, and poetry is particularly safe. It would be there when I came out.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you think of a state-run institution for the aged, you might imagine hollow eyes behind a web of shadows. Emptiness, desperation. In this way the home is a disappointment. To be sure, there are people sitting around, but most of them are waiting to start an argument about fish and game regulations or how the state should spend the oil money to establish craft guilds or senior citizens&#x2019; advisory boards. The place is well lit and the halls have thick carpet to avoid the executioner&#x2019;s sound of nurses&#x2019; shoes squeaking on linoleum. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked up Mrs. Victor&#x2019;s room number on the front board in the lobby and I walked down the first-floor hall to room 104. Behind one door there was florid organ music from a TV and a woman&#x2019;s voice with a Boston accent saying, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have to stand here and be made a fool of, Gregory!&#x201d; Then music swells and the commercial break. Then a human voice: &#x201c;Come on, drink it and I&#x2019;ll ask the doctor about new medication when he comes by.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I expected Mrs. Victor&#x2019;s room to be tomblike. Dark and small, with the smell of medicine and cleaning products. I knocked and heard a faint rustling behind the door. When I opened it I stepped into a searing light. The sun was coming up through her open window and all of her lamps were lit. She sat in the corner, sunk down in her wheelchair, elbows propped out like chicken wings on the armrests. She was smoking a cigarette, and the ticking of the clock in her room was unusually loud as if time had just begun.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Mrs. Victor? I&#x2019;m Cecil Younger. Did you want to see me?&#x201d; I took off my leather windbreaker and draped it over my arm. &#x201c;Mrs. Victor?&#x201d; I had to shade my eyes to face her.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman in the wheelchair had her head bowed, and the smoke from the cigarette rose up around her face, curling under her wire-framed glasses. I watched it gather, blue and hazy, in the corner of her ceiling. She had raven black hair streaked with white. Her fist resting on the arm of her chair was dark as a walnut. She rocked forward very slowly. &#x201c;Mr. Younger, I have some questions that no one will help me with. I want to know the truth about something. I need a detective.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sat on the bed, the springs creaked slightly, and I felt the fur-bearing animal in my stomach twist suddenly toward my throat.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&#x2019;t really think of myself as a disappointment to my family, but everyone I come into contact with does. They think of my father as &#x201c;the sainted Judge Younger.&#x201d; When they have to talk to me the tone of their voices and their bloodhound eyes give them away: failure . . . at least the Judge isn&#x2019;t alive to see it anymore. He was a man who could give you the whole truth, but as a private investigator the best I can do is try and create the most acceptable version. My sister, who is not a failure, is an idealistic law school professor. She once said to me in the middle of a case, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t confuse the issue with the truth, just develop the facts!&#x201d; So much for idealism. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cops are different, they&#x2019;re right there with sirens screaming and lights flashing, speaking to breathless witnesses who usually don&#x2019;t have time to think. &#x201c;Have a seat, ma&#x2019;am. You&#x2019;ll feel better if you just tell me the whole truth.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s weeks, maybe months, by the time I get to them. Impressions<br> have changed to suit opinions, and everyone wants to become a judge. If cops collect the oral history of a crime, I gather folklore. And people who have set themselves up to be the judge rarely accept folklore as the whole truth, unless it&#x2019;s their own story they&#x2019;re telling.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Do you need a policeman, Mrs. Victor?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I have been to the police. I have been to the district attorney&#x2019;s. My son has been murdered and I want to know the whole truth.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I watched the haze of her cigarette smoke clear as a breath of cold wind blew in through the window. I remembered her son, Louis Victor, the Indian big-game guide. The Brown Bear Man, shot with a high-powered rifle by a crazy man. His body had been consumed by the bears near one of his hunting cabins. The facts were long on irony and short on conclusions. Sy Brown was the crazy man&#x2019;s attorney. I had wanted the case, but by that time I had been fired from the Public Defender Agency and the crazy man couldn&#x2019;t afford even my violent-crime-of-the-month special of $100 a day.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Excuse me, Mrs. Victor, but didn&#x2019;t they convict someone of your son&#x2019;s murder? Isn&#x2019;t he already in prison?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She shook her head slowly. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t understand. Maybe you can&#x2019;t. The police told me about the man; he&#x2019;s not right. He talks to himself. He picked up a gun and killed Louis, then left his body for the bears to eat. I know how it happened.&#x201d; She banged her gnarled fist on the arm of the wheelchair. &#x201c;I want to know why.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Why&#x2014;? Mrs. Victor, the man was, is, crazy, unbalanced. He probably doesn&#x2019;t have a reason for killing your son, or at least a reason that you or I can understand. It was a tragic, unforeseeable accident: like an anvil falling out of the sky and killing him.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;White people!&#x201d; She shook her head bitterly; her nostrils pushed out a squall of smoke. &#x201c;Anvils do not fall out of the sky.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bug in my inner ear twitched and I felt the tears coming on. I took in a breath and fought them off.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She leaned forward and pointed her finger at me as if it were a revolver. &#x201c;My mother could talk to animals. She could talk to the raven and the bear. She talked to the killer whale because the killer whales were our ancestors. But I am a Christian now. I go to the cathedral and if I said I talked to animals you would think I was crazy. I don&#x2019;t talk to animals. I talk to the air and the animals listen.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind her the sun dipped behind a cloud and the shadow filtered into the room. Outside her window was a chain-link fence around a flower bed. I saw the raven with the red thread chuckling above a dormant rhododendron.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Anvils don&#x2019;t fall out of the sky like in some silly cartoon. Someone drops them. I want to pay you, Mr. Younger, to find whoever is responsible for my son&#x2019;s murder.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked at my hands and rocked back. I could use the job. If I took it on, I could dig up all the paper on the case, take a couple of days to read it, talk to some of her friends and family and see what she wanted to believe and then give it to her. That&#x2019;s the way it usually works, at least if you want to satisfy your client. It would be a four- or five-hundred-dollar job plus a trip to the prison in Juneau where the largest population of my former clients lives.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I can look into it for you.&#x201d;</p><h2>High Fashion Sewing Secrets from the World&#39;s Best Designers: A Step-By-Step Guide to Sewing Stylish Seams, Buttonholes, Pockets, Collars, Hems, And More</h2><p>In High Fashion Sewing Secrets from the World's Best Designers internationally known sewing expert Claire Schaeffer reveals the secrets of high-fashion legends such as Geoffrey Beene, Ralph Lauren, Oscar de la Renta, Yves Saint Laurent, Liz Claiborne, and Calvin Klein.

Only six men have written a major work on Old Testament ethics in the last hundred years, and only two of these works, both written before 1900, are in English. This lack of materials on Old Testament ethics serves to underscore the significance of Walter Kaiser&#39;s Toward Old Testament Ethics. Dr. Kaiser has no illusions about providing a simple solution to questions of Old Testament ethics. He is familiar with the complexities of this subject and begins his work in Part I by addressing such questions as: How can ethics be defined? Is there an overarching structure to ethics as presented in the Old Testament, or is there only an unrelated series of laws? Do ethics of the Old Testament have any relevance for us today? What are the exegetical principles to be used in a study of Old Testament ethics? Part II examines the moral texts of the Old Testament, in particular the Decalogue, the book of the covenant (Exodus 20:22--23:33), and the law of holiness (Leviticus 18--20). Dr. Kaiser unfolds the intention of these various laws, showing how they relate to each other and form a framework for ethics. Part III explores the content of Old Testament ethics, namely, how holiness relates to worship, work, relationship, social justice, the sanctity of life, marriage and sex, wealth, use of the truth, and motives for action. Moral difficulties in the Old Testament present stumbling blocks to many who read these books. How are we to relate to a God who, at times, seems fickle, deceptive, and hateful? How are we to champion the offensive view of women and slaves, the particulars of God choosing Israel, and the imprecations that appear from time to time in the biblical texts? Reponses to these and other difficulties from Part IV. The book concludes with a discussion of Old Testament law and New Testament believers. Dr. Kaiser shows how these laws, written thousands of years ago, still challenge God&#39;s people to live holy lives.Walter C. Kaiser Jr. (PhD, Brandeis University) is distinguished professor emeritus of Old Testament and president emeritus of Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary in South Hamilton, Massachusetts. Dr. Kaiser has written over 40 books, including Toward an Exegetical Theology: Biblical Exegesis for Preaching and Teaching; The Messiah in the Old Testament; and The Promise-Plan of God; and coauthored An Introduction to Biblical Hermeneutics: The Search for Meaning.

The poems tell of cats lost, cats loved and cats observedof the alley cat who "loved/ (as much as she loved anthing at all)/ a garbage can," and Miss Tibbles who lies like a "fur ring" on a little girl's lap until she wonders, "Is it me or Tibbles purring?" Like a sketch book from a master artist, Hyman's drawings show cats from every angle; they paw at snowflakes, leave tracks "like dark fern seed," roll in catnip, walk on "on marshmallow paws," and they will beguile cat lovers of all ages.

Like his Northern counterpart, the Confederate soldier fought against bullets, starvation, miserable weather, disease, and mental strain. But the experience was perhaps even worse for Johnny Reb because of the odds against him. Never as well equipped and provisioned as the Yankee, he nevertheless performed heroically.&nbsp;Carlton McCarthy, a private in the Army of Northern Virginia, describes the not-always-regular rations, various improvisations in clothing and weaponry, campfire entertainments, the jaunty spirits and the endless maneuvering of the men in gray. Real but forgotten faces are glimpsed momentarily in famous battles, and the tramp of feet on the way to Appomattox is heard.

Herman, who just happens to be a crocodile, is an oboe player (the instrument fits nicely under his enormous teeth). He lives in a tiny apartment, loves boysenberry yogurt, and likes &#x201c;watching films about the ocean.&#x201d; Rosie, of the deer persuasion, enjoys &#x201c;toffee that sticks to your teeth,&#x201d; jazz singing, and also watching ocean-themed films. Never the twain shall meet, until Herman loses his job &#x201c;selling things,&#x201d; and Rosie&#x2019;s jazz club closes down due to poor attendance. When each comes out of a depression, Herman picks up the oboe, and Rosie finds herself drawn across rooftops towards its &#x201c;groovy tune.&#x201d; Soon the lonely city is lonely no more as they make sweet, sweet music together. This Australian picture book doesn&#x2019;t skimp on fantastic details: Rosie&#x2019;s club is called The Mangy Hound; Herman&#x2019;s call center is inhabited by boars, giraffes, and owls; and Grandma Herman&#x2019;s photo sits framed on the bureau. Gordon&#x2019;s heavily lined characters and collage backgrounds give rise to the vibrant Big Apple, populated by all species and anchored by two endearing artistic types. The illustrations include scenes depicted on postcards as the duo moves around the city, maps of their wanderings, and even a page comprised entirely of neon signs (&#x201c;Dancing Hamsters&#x201d;) that light up the night sky. Not since Petra Mathers&#x2019; Sophie and Lou (1991) has a picture book, the arts, and romance converged so charmingly.

In the late '60s and early '70s, filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich had conducted extensive interviews with Welles, but a number of circumstances--including the director's decision to compose an autobiography that he never got around to writing--kept the interviews out of the public eye. Edited and annotated by Jonathan Rosenbaum, these conversations give wonderful insights into Welles's craft and personality. He discusses his forays into acting, producing, and writing as well as directing, his confidences and insecurities, and his plans for film projects that were either never made or only partially completed. He also offers insights into the triumph of <i>Citizen Kane</i> and later masterpieces like <i>The Lady from Shanghai</i>, <i>Touch of Evil</i>, <i>Othello</i>, and <i>Chimes at Midnight</i>. His defense of his controversial adaptation of Kafka's <i>The Trial</i> is so fascinating that readers might want to rush out and rent the film.<p> While the book is worth owning just for this 322-page interview, it is also full of other material that is equally revealing. Rosenbaum presents a meticulous chronology of Welles's life, closely following his day-to-day activities from his birth in 1915 to his death in 1985. Anyone who thinks that Welles was an essentially lazy and profligate artist will be astonished at how hard he worked and how much he accomplished, even after the completion of <i>Citizen Kane</i>. Another treat found in the book is a detailed description--complete with rare photographic stills--of the original <i>Magnificent Ambersons</i>, Welles's impressive follow-up to <i>Kane</i>, which can now be seen only in a tragically truncated version. </p><p> This 1998 reissue of the volume contains a fond new introduction by Bogdanovich and another crucial piece of Welles minutia, excerpts from his 58-page memo to Universal Pictures about the editing of <i>Touch of Evil</i>. Forty years after its composition, the material in this memo has been used to create a restored "director's cut" of the film. With such grand material between two covers, <i>This Is Orson Welles</i> is the most informative and entertaining book available on one of the 20th century's greatest artists. <i>--Raphael Shargel</i></p>Orson Welles (1915-1985) was the last true Renaissance man of the twentieth century. From such great radio works as &#34;War of the Worlds&#34; to his cinematic masterpieces Citizen Kane, The Magnificent Ambersons, Othello, Macbeth, Touch of Evil, and Chimes at Midnight, Welles was a master storyteller. This is Orson Welles, a collection of penetrating and witty conversations between Welles and Peter Bogdanovich, includes insights into: Welles&#39; radio, theater, film, and television work; Hollywood producers, directors, and stars; and almost everything else, from acting to magic, literature to comic strips, bullfighters to gangsters.</p><h2>The Layman&#39;s Bible Dictionary (Limited Edition)</h2><p>Over 2,500 concise entries, are all the essential facts about the most significant Bible peole, places, things, and ideas.

The national organization has rigid standards for this activity, and a local chapter may find that it takes a year or more to complete the required process. First we authenticate the soldier whose grave is to be marked. We find his record, which is usually not very difficult to do; but this calls for research and correspondence that can take several months. Then we must locate the grave as accurately as possible. Down here in southwestern Virginia and east Tennessee, many of the old soldiers were buried without gravestones or in graves that were marked with limestone or sandstone that has crumbled beyond recognition. "National" takes a reasonable attitude toward our problems. But we are all very anxious to be accurate, andidentifying unmarked or untended graves can be very difficult.When the soldier has been researched and the grave located, a bronze marker is ordered and paid for by the chapter, and a ceremony is held at the grave when the marker is put in place.The grave we were looking for was that of Adoniram Philipson. Philipson enlisted in 1778 at the age of seventeen and managed to be so severely wounded in his first battle that he was a cripple for life. It was a long life; and since Philipson died in 1851, and thus appeared in the 1850 census as a resident of Ambrose County, Virginia, we had assumed that we would find his grave without much search. He ought to have been with the rest of his family in the cemetery at Ambrose Courthouse.But he was not. The chapter began work on poor old Adoniram in 1976 as a Bicentennial project. By the time Philipson died, there were few Revolutionary War veterans remaining; and Adoniram enjoyed considerable fame in our corner of the world. Thus there was an abundance of records. But we were absolutely balked when we tried to locate the grave.We never quite gave the project up, but it was knocking around as unfinished business for almost ten years--until, in fact, I received a letter from George FitzSimmons Francis of Roanoke. Mr. Francis is very knowledgeable about southwest Virginia history; and in his researches he had found correspondence in which there was the sentence: "We laid Uncle Ad beside Cousin Emily Dunbar." The writer was Elizabeth Philipson Davis.This information gave us a strong lead to follow because the Dunbars were a numerous family along the Holston where it flows into the state of Tennessee.After some intense research, our Elizabeth Wheeler turnedup evidence that Emily Dunbar was a daughter of Adoniram Philipson's youngest sister. And when Elizabeth reported this to our November meeting last year, Margaret Chalmers, who grew up in the valley, announced that the Dunbars, although they had died out or moved away long before her time, were buried in great numbers in the Brown Spring Cemetery. And wonder of wonders, the Brown Spring Cemetery is just barely above the Tennessee line. Otherwise a Virginia chapter would be unable to mark the grave.We learned all of that in the November meeting and were so encouraged that I thought we ought to complete this business right away.With the Christmas music, however, and gifts, and cards--not to mention family--and with perfectly horrible weather in January, I felt that Adoniram's grave could go unmarked at least until we had a few sunny days.The first such day came on February 22--Washington's <i>real</i> birthday, and a Tuesday. The sun was just rising clear over the knobs--it had not done so for three weeks--as Henry was getting off to the office. It seemed to me that all things were auspicious.I called Margaret Chalmers, indispensable because she would have to pilot me to the cemetery. Yes, she could go--she would be glad to get out of the house.Then because Elizabeth Wheeler was not only on the committee, but also because she enjoys cemeteries more than any other person I have ever known, I called her; and she could go.I have to confess that I hesitated before I called Harriet Bushrow. If I had not called her, we might never have solved the mystery. But that is neither there nor there, because I called her although I had a qualm about taking her to such a place as the Brown Spring Cemetery. She is eighty-six and had a serious bout with flu in January. She is not as steady onher feet as she used to be. She is not actually large--that is to say not remarkably so--but because of the terrain we might encounter and the flu she had just had, I was afraid there might be difficulty.Then I told myself that undoubtedly Harriet had been shut up in the house for several weeks and it would really be good for her to get out. There is, of course, a certain friction between Harriet and Elizabeth; and I suppose I had better explain why.In order to join the DAR, one must be able to prove her legitimate descent from someone who fought on the American side in the Revolution or someone who furnished material aid to the colonists. After descent has been proved, she "goes in" on such-and-such as ancestor. The daughter then wears on her blue and white DAR ribbon a gold bar with the ancestor's name and rank engraved on it. If the daughter has other revolutionary ancestors, she may send proof to National and wear additional ancestor bars. Some daughters take great pride in the number of bars decorating their ribbons.Elizabeth Wheeler has thirty-two bars!That is, in fact, one gold bar for every male ancestor of military age in her entire lineage at the time of the Revolution. And she has three other ancestors she could claim in cases where both father and son aided the colonists.I don't know that Elizabeth is unique in this matter, but it is a rare daughter that glitters as she does when she drapes her ribbons over her modest little chest. On the other hand, there is not a single commissioned officer in the whole collection. As Elizabeth herself will say, they were very ordinary people. But she will add that they all did their duty and--what is more important for her purposes--left a record of it.Harriet, on the other hand! Well, Harriet has only three bars, and it rankles, because Harriet Gardner Bushrow is decidedly aristocratic with glamorous ancestors that far outshineElizabeth's. One was Major General Archibald Hadley, and another was Lieutentant General Nathan Andrews. But Harriet can secure ancestral bars for neither of these. General Andrews, being somewhat older than Hadley, had a beautiful daughter. After the war Hadley was so captivated by Miss Andrews that he eloped with her, leaving behind a legal Mrs. Hadley and several small and very legitimate Hadleys. The Hadley-Andrews alliance prospered without benefit of law, and the descendants married into the best families. Since Harriet's mother was twice a Hadley (that is, there was a marriage of cousins a few generations ago), the two generals appear twice in her ancestry and thus eliminate four possible bars.Physically too, Harriet and Elizabeth are as different as can be. Elizabeth is somewhat under five feet tall and weighs in the neighborhood of ninety in her galoshes. At seventy-five, she is a lively, bright-eyed retired domestic science teacher, who always wears a little dark suit and a white shirt waist with ruffled collar and cuffs.Harriet, on the other hand, seems to have inherited the military bearing of her famous and illegitimate ancestors. Even now she can draw herself up and be the handsomest figure in the room.Although Harriet's house is neither large nor old--and I might add that it is very plain--she has furnished it with moveables of museum quality--not at all the usual personal collection, for she had nothing made after 1830 or originating at a distance greater than one hundred miles of the Virginia-Tennessee border.Harriet wears pronounced colors--a good strong rose, forest green, or russet--and hats with wide brims, always sloping at a raffish angle so that she looks like a duchess by Leley or even Van Dyck. And there is always her cut crystal necklace of which she is so fond.Enough about Harriet. Now let me say something about Margaret Chalmers.Of course, there's really not much to say about Margaret. Her husband sold life insurance and apparently bought his own policies, because he died about twenty years ago and left Margaret in comfortable condition. She has no children, but she makes up for that deficiency with nieces, nephews, old aunts and uncles, and endless cousins. I am very fond of Margaret. If possible, I like to have her share a room with me at State Conference.By the time I had collected everybody in the Pontiac and got on the Valley Pike, it was two-thirty. Since we were going into Margaret's special part of the county, she had her local history well in hand and was eager to entertain us with it."Helen," she began in her soft voice, "did you know that Dr. Edmond Spooner camped at Brown Spring in seventeen fifty-eight?"Seventeen fifty-eight marks the first authenticated exploration of our area.I: "Did he?"Elizabeth: "He did." This came with great authority, for that is the sort of thing that Elizabeth knows.Margaret: "Grandfather Weathered's big log house burned, but the chimneys are still standing. You can see them over there on the left."Elizabeth: "My ancestor, George Bennington, was a mason; he made half the chimneys in Chinahook County, Father used to say."I: "How interesting!"Thus my conversation alternated with the two, each of the ladies contributing scraps of information known only to themselves and leaving Harriet as completely out of it as if shehad stayed at home. Harriet, you see, grew up in South Carolina and has no family ties to our local area.Harriet's silence was icy. When I glimpsed her in the rearview mirror, that big hat was drooping over her face so that all I could see was the firm set of her jaw and her cut crystal beads flashing as she breathed.We got behind a school bus just coming out from the Valley Pike Elementary School. As the bus stopped at every farm house, Margaret would recognize at least one child in each group that left the vehicle. This led to an individual detail of family history each time we came to a halt; and since Valley Pike is excessively crooked and also narrow, I had no chance to pass.Elizabeth, on the other hand, found a way to enlarge the genealogical information related in every story contributed by Margaret. From time to time Harriet made an effort to start a different conversation.Harriet: "Helen, do you like the Plymouth?"I: "This is a Pontiac, Harriet."Harriet: "Oh!"After another five minutes of Margaret's local history enlarged by Elizabeth's footnotes, Harriet would try again.Harriet: "Helen, do you find your heating bills high this year?"We followed Valley Pike to Hipple's Store, then turned on Farm Road 17 until we reached the Hersey place, a grand old log house with clapboard siding and additions in all directions. The oaks are even older than the house and spread above it with great gnarled branches. At Margaret's direction I turned off onto a dirt road, which served well until we passed the Billy Pennybacker place, where the ruts became downright unpleasant and I began to worry about my shock absorbers. I drove on, dead slowly, for about ten minutes--back into the knobs. Margaret pointed out where the BrownSpring Church had stood before it was torn down, and we could see Brown Branch meandering off through the fields. At last we came to a rusty fence and a huge arch made of pipe with a somewhat battered sign hanging from its apex to tell us that we had arrived at the Brown Spring Cemetery. It was rather a pretty cemetery, cut out of the woods and lying between two knobs to the right and to the left. It was somewhat larger than I had expected it would be. Immediately in front of us there was a grassy slope crowned with monuments and stones--leaning this way and that, but always expectantly facing east. Perhaps thirty yards beyond the gate there was a slight rise, and apparently the cemetery sloped around on the other side and continued a short distance up the hollow.The cemetery association had done an efficient job on the weeds and brambles, and I was relieved to see that I need not have feared that my ladies could not negotiate the terrain.I am always impressed by the quiet of a country cemetery, and apparently so were my passengers; for as the Pontiac's engine died, our conversation died also.We disembarked and entered almost timidly--perhaps with the feeling that we were intruding. Quietly we made our way through the gate, the only sound beside our footsteps resulting from Harriet's opening her purse to get a cough drop.Suddenly Elizabeth broke our reverie with a polite shriek--"Hunsuckers!"It sounded as though we were being warned of something--possibly a bird that would swoop down and attack us."And there's another one!"Elizabeth is in her personal element in a cemetery, and we could tell that she was prepared to be delighted by this one."I have Hunsuckers!""Elizabeth Wheeler," Harriet said with annoyance, "What on earth are you talking about?""Great-Uncle John Payne married a Hunsucker," Elizabeth explained. "And just look at them!""Yes, there were a lot of them," said Margaret."Well," Harriet said, slightly out of humor, "by all means let Elizabeth collect her Hunsuckers while the rest of us locate Adoniram Philipson."We did in fact find Adoniram Philipson. He was among the trees just outside the fence, which was perhaps put up at some time after Adoniram went to his long home. The stone was broken, lying face down and almost buried. It had apparently been in that condition for many years. But since it was only a fragment and the whole stone had not been very large anyhow, I had no trouble prying it up and turning it over. We felt ourselves very fortunate to be able to read:ADON. PHIBORN 1760--DII took shelf paper and a cobbler's heel from a shopping bag I always carry when I go to a cemetery. A rubbing makes the report a little more interesting to the chapter. I taped the paper to the stone and began rubbing briskly as Harriet and Margaret watched.Suddenly we heard a stage whisper from Elizabeth and saw her running toward us at a strange little tiptoe pace."There is a man up there," she said in an excited whisper. "I think he needs help.""Well, Elizabeth," Harriet boomed, "did you offer to help him?""I did clear my throat," Elizabeth said, "but he didn't move. He's lying partly behind a tombstone. I didn't get too close."Harriet, always the descendant of generals, led off firmly as I put my rubbing equipment into my market bag. Elizabethand Margaret followed Harriet, and I brought up the rear--somewhat like the barnyard friends of Chicken Little.At the peak of the slight rise, Elizabeth pointed to a tombstone with MOTHER carved across it in huge letters. Visible from behind one side of it, a pair of legs in blue jeans sprawled at an unnatural a...A delightful first novel relating the experiences of some members of the Old Orchard Fort chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution in Borderville, Virginia, in solving the murder of Luis Garcia, a world-renowned harpist from California. The chapter's savvy Regent, Helen Delaporte, along with other members, discovered Garcia's beaten corpse while placing a grave marker in an out-of-the-way cemetery. Sheriff Butch Gilroy dismisses the unidentified body as that of just another drifter, but Helen- -curiosity sparked--makes some astute deductions that lead to a positive identification. Now she wants to know why the victim, on the eve of a world tour, would detour to this backwoods area. Helen enlists the help of three DAR stalwarts--one of them expert in local genealogy; another the gutsy, guileful 86-year-old Harriet Bushrow (no flies on her!). The ladies take turns telling their part in the saga. The result is a story full of suspense, lively characters, and unforced homespun charm. The DAR should be grateful. Readers of this divertingly different first-class murder mystery will be too. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The 18 double-page chapters, all heavily illustrated, cover pioneers in the United States from the late 1700s to the mid-1800s. Some chapters start with present-tense descriptions of typical wagon train events, such as a birth, then shift, sometimes abruptly, to straight descriptive information. Chapters featuring notable individuals are interspersed between more general ones, adding to the jumbled effect. The only map is on the frontispiece and lacks date and mountain range identification. The roughly chronological arrangement moves from early Appalachian pioneers to later west coast expansion, but incidents and anecdotes often interrupt the sequence. Davy Crockett appears before Lewis and Clark, and the lawmen and criminals from the 1870s are mentioned (without dates) before the California Gold Rush. Other dates are also missing. The author does a decent job of capturing the adventurous pioneer spirit, but, with the exception of the Gold Rush, generally passes over the various reasons why families chose to endure the hardships of a westward move. Though sod homes and log cabins are described, the focus is on the journeys of pioneers; the establishment of new communities and towns is not mentioned. Despite the awkward arrangement, the writing is solid, with many brief anecdotes and summaries of first-person accounts. The plentiful illustrations lend an inviting air to the large pages, though they are unspectacular.

Cringely's <i>Accidental Empires</i> and Michael A. Hiltzik's <i>Dealers of Lightning</i> are just two excellent accounts of the unprecedented explosion of tech entrepreneurs and their game-changing success. But Walter Isaacson goes them one better: <i>The Innovators</i>, his follow-up to the massive (in both sales and size) <i>Steve Jobs</i>, is probably the widest-ranging and most comprehensive narrative of them all. Don't let the scope or page-count deter you: while Isaacson builds the story from the 19th century--innovator by innovator, just as the players themselves stood atop the achievements of their predecessors--his discipline and era-based structure allows readers to dip in and out of digital history, from Charles Babbage's Difference Engine, to Alan Turing and the codebreakers of Bletchley Park, to Tim Berners-Lee and the birth of the World Wide Web (with contextual nods to influential counterculture weirdos along the way). Isaacson's presentation is both brisk and illuminating; while it doesn't supersede previous histories, <i>The Innovators</i> might be the definitive overview, and it's certainly one hell of a read. --<i>Jon Foro</i></p>Walter Isaacson, University Professor of History at Tulane, has been CEO of the Aspen Institute, chairman of CNN, and editor of&nbsp;<i>Time</i>&nbsp;magazine.

On an afternoon in March the sunlight did not penetrate the Gothic windows, and the room seemed dim, the carpet, the hangings, and the tooled leather backs of the books in the carved shelves as faded as the uniform of the man who sat motionless at the desk, his hands lying clasped on a sheaf of papers, his gaze fixed on a clump of daffodils, nodding in the wind that soughed round the angles of the house, and passed like a shadow over the unscythed lawn.<br><br>The uniform showed the buff facings and silver lace of the 52nd Regiment; it was as threadbare as the carpet, but for all its shabbiness it seemed incongruous: as out of place in this quiet room as the man who wore it felt himself to be.<br><br>He should not have done so: the Priory was his birthplace, and he owned it; but his adult years had been spent in very different scenes from the placid fens and wolds of Lincolnshire, and his transition from the grandeur of the Pyrenees had been too sudden, and attended by circumstances of too much horror to make it seem to him anything other than a bad dream from which he would presently be awakened by a call to arms, or by a stampeding mule brought down by the guy-ropes of his tent, or by the mere bustle of a camp at first light.<br><br>The letters from England had reached him on the last day of January. He had first read his mother's, written in the agitation of her bereavement, and conveying to him in a barely legible series of crossed and recrossed lines the news that his father was dead. He had been more shocked than grieved, never having enjoyed more than a casual acquaintance with the late Viscount. Lord Lynton, while bluff and good-natured when confronted with any of his offspring, had not been blessed with domestic virtues. A close friend of the Prince Regent, he had so much preferred the Prince's society to that of his family that very little of his time had been spent in his home, and none at all in considering what might be the hopes or characteristics of one surviving son and two daughters.<br><br>He had been killed in the hunting-field, in the first burst, taking a double at the fly: not a surprising end for an intrepid and frequently reckless horseman. What did surprise his son was to discover that contrary to advice and entreaty he had been riding a green and headstrong young horse, never before tried in the field. Lord Lynton was a bruising rider, but not a fool; his heir, knowing the wild hurly-burly of a first burst with the Quorn or the Belvoir, concluded that he had ridden his young 'un for a wager, and passed on to a maternal command to sell out instantly, and return to England, where his presence was most urgently needed.<br><br>The new Lord Lynton (but it was to be many weeks before he answered readily to any other title than Captain Deveril) could not find in his mother's letter any reason why he should pursue a course so repugnant to himself. The letter from Lord Lynton's man of business was less impassioned but more explicit.<br><br>He read it twice before his brain was able to grasp its horrifying intelligence, and many times before he laid it before his Colonel.<br><br>No one could have been kinder; to no one else, indeed, could Adam Deveril have borne to have disclosed that letter. Colonel Colborne had read it, his countenance unmoved, and he had offered no unwanted sympathy. "You must go," he had said, "I'll grant you furlough immediately, to expedite the business, but you'll sell out, of course." Then, guessing the thoughts hidden behind Adam's rigid countenance, he had added: "A year ago there might have been doubts which way your duty should have led you, but there are none now. We shall soon have Soult on the run in good earnest. I shan't say you won't be missed: you will be&#x2014;damnably!&#x2014;but your absence won't affect the issue <em>here. </em>There's no question about it, you know: you must go home to England."<br><br>He had known it, of course, and had argued neither with his Colonel nor his own conscience. He had sailed on the first available transport, and, after a brief halt in London, had posted on to Lincolnshire, leaving his man of business to discover the extent of his liabilities, and his tailor to deliver with all possible expedition raiment suited to a civilian gentleman in deep mourning.<br><br>This had not yet arrived, but the news that his Regiment had distinguished itself at the Battle of Orthes had reached Fontley, making him at once exultant and wretched; and Mr Wimmering had presented himself at Fontley on the previous day. He had spent the night at the Priory; but the younger Miss Deveril was of the opinion that he could not have enjoyed more than two or three hours of sleep, since he had remained closeted with her brother until dawn. He was very civil to the ladies, so it was unkind of her to liken him to a bird of ill-omen. He was very civil to the new Viscount, too, and very patient, answering all his questions without betraying that he found him lamentably ignorant.<br><br>Adam said, with a smile in his tired gray eyes: "You must think me a fool to ask you so many stupid questions. I'm a Johnny Raw, you see. I've never dealt with such matters as these. I don't understand them, and I must."<br><br>No, Mr Wimmering did not think his lordship a fool, but deeply did he regret that the late Viscount had not seen fit to admit him to his confidence. But the late Viscount had not seen fit to admit even his man of business wholly into his confidence: there had been transactions on the Stock Exchange in which agents unknown to Wimmering had been employed. He said mournfully: "I could not have advised his lordship to invest his money as he sometimes did. But his nature was sanguine&#x2014;and I must acknowledge that on several occasions he was fortunate in ventures which I, as a man of affairs, could not have recommended to him." He refreshed himself with a pinch of snuff taken from the battered silver box which he had been tapping with the tip of one desiccated finger, and added: "I was well-acquainted with your honoured parent, my lord, and have for long been persuaded that it was his hope to have restored to its former prosperity the inheritance to which he succeeded, and which, he knew, must in the course of nature presently fall into your hands. The speculative, and, alas, unlucky, enterprise upon which he entered shortly before his untimely demise&#x2014;" He broke off, transferring his gaze from Adam's face to the line of swaying tree-tops beyond the gardens. To them he apparently addressed the rest of his speech, saying: "It should never be forgotten that his late lordship's nature was, as I have remarked, sanguine. Dear me, yes! If I had a hundred pounds for every occasion on which his lordship suffered reverses on 'Change without the least diminution of his optimism I should be a wealthy man, I assure you, sir!"<br><br>No answer was vouchsafed to this. Adam, instead of seeking further reassurance, said in an even tone: "In plain words, Wimmering, how do my affairs stand?"<br><br>Plain words, in situations of the utmost delicacy, were obnoxious to Wimmering, but, impelled by some quality in that quiet voice, he replied with unaccustomed bluntness: "Badly, my lord."<br><br>Adam nodded. "How badly?"<br><br>Mr Wimmering set his fingertips exactly together, and replied evasively: "It is in the highest degree unfortunate that your lordship's grandfather should have deceased before the coming of age of his late lordship. It was his intention to have resettled the estates. At that time, as I need not remind your lordship, my own revered parent stood in the same relation to the Fourth Viscount as I have stood in to the Fifth, and&#x2014;if I may be permitted to express the wish&#x2014;as I hope to stand in to your lordship. When you, my lord, attained your majority, it was my earnest desire to have induced his late lordship to repair an omission rendered inevitable by the inscrutable workings of Providence. His lordship, however, did not consider the moment opportune for the prosecution of a design which, I assure you, he had very much at heart. <em>Your </em>presence, my lord, must have been essential: I can have no need to recall to your mind the circumstances which would have made it hard indeed for you to have applied for furlough just then. The Combat of the Coa! It seems but yesterday that we were eagerly perusing the account of that engagement, with the words of commendation bestowed by Lord Wellington on the officers and the men of your lordship's Regiment!"<br><br>"The estates, I collect, were even then encumbered?" interpolated his lordship.<br><br>Mr Wimmering bowed his head in sorrowful assent, but raised it again to offer a palliative. "But her ladyship's jointure was secured to her."<br><br>"And my sisters' portions?"<br><br>Wimmering sighed. After a pause, Adam said: "The case seems to be desperate. What must I do?"<br><br>"Serious, my lord, but not desperate, we must trust." He raised his hand, as Adam made a gesture towards the mass of papers on his desk. "Let me beg of you not to refine too much upon demands which were, under the circumstances, inevitable! None are immediately pressing. A certain degree of alarm in the creditors was to be expected, and to allay that must be&#x2014;indeed, <em>has </em>been&#x2014;my first concern. I do not by any means despair of composing all these matters."<br><br>"I have no great head for figures," Adam replied, "but I think the debts total a larger amount than my disposable assets." He picked up a paper, and studied it. "You have set no value on the racing-stables, I observe. Those, I think, should be sold at once, and also the town house."<br><br>"Upon no account!" interrupted Wimmering earnestly. "Such an action, my lord, would prove fatal, believe me! Let me repeat that my care has been to allay anxiety: until we see our way more clearly that is most necessary."<br><br>Adam laid the paper down. "It is already clear to me. I am facing ruin, am I not?"<br><br>"Your lordship takes too despondent a view. The shock has overset you! But we need not despair."<br><br>"No, if I had time enough, and the means, perhaps I could restore our fortunes. Surely Fontley was prosperous in my grandfather's day? Since I came home I have been going all about with our bailiff, trying to learn from him in a week the things I ought to have learnt when I was a boy. Instead&#x2014;" he smiled rather painfully "&#x2014;I was army-mad. One doesn't realise, or foresee&#x2014; But repining won't help me out of my difficulties. The land here is as rich as any in Lincolnshire, but so much needs to be done! And if I had the means to do it I should wish above all things to redeem the mortgages, and that I certainly have not the means to do."<br><br>"My lord, not all your lands are mortgaged! Do not, I beg of you&#x2014;"<br><br>"Mercifully, not all. The house, and the demesne-lands are unencumbered. Can you tell me what price we should set on them? Both have been neglected, but the Priory is generally thought to be beautiful, and has, besides, historic interest."<br><br>"Sell Fontley?" exclaimed Wimmering, aghast. "Your lordship cannot be serious! You are speaking in jest, of course!"<br><br>"No, I am not speaking in jest," Adam replied quietly. "I don't think I ever felt less like jesting in my life. If you could show me how to pay off this load of debt, how to provide for my sisters without selling Fontley&#x2014;but you can't, can you?"<br><br>"My lord," said Wimmering, recovering his countenance, "I trust I may be able to do so. It might not be an easy task, but it has occurred to me&#x2014;if I may speak frankly on a subject of an intimate nature?"<br><br>Adam looked surprised, but nodded.<br><br>"Such unhappy situations as this are not of such rare occurrence as one could wish, my lord," said Mr Wimmering, intently scrutinising his fingers. "I could tell you of cases within my own experience where the sadly fallen fortunes of a noble house have been resuscitated by a judicious alliance."<br><br>"Good God, are you suggesting that I should marry an heiress?" Adam demanded.<br><br>"It has frequently been done, my lord."<br><br>"I daresay it has, but you mustn't expect me to do it, I'm afraid," returned Adam. "I don't think I'm acquainted with any heiresses, and I'm sure I shouldn't be regarded as an eligible suitor."<br><br>"On the contrary, my lord! Your lineage is distinguished; you are the holder of a title; the owner of very considerable estates, and of a seat&#x2014;as you have said yourself-&#x2014;of historic interest."<br><br>"I never suspected that you had a turn for nonsense!" Adam interrupted. "These possessions of mine are very fine-sounding until you tap them, when they have a hollow ring. In any event, I don't contemplate putting myself up for sale."<br><br>There was a note of finality in his voice, and Wimmering bowed to it, content for the present to have instilled the idea into his brain. He might recoil from it, but Wimmering had formed a favourable opinion of his good sense, and he hoped that when he had recovered from the shock of finding himself on the brink of ruin he would perceive the advantages of what was, in his adviser's view, a very simple way out of his difficulties. It was fortunate that he was unattached&#x2014;if he <em>was </em>unattached. Wimmering knew that a year previously he had fancied himself in love with Lord Oversley's daughter; but no notice of an engagement had ever appeared, and the connection had not met with the Fifth Viscount's approbation. The Fifth Viscount had been quite as anxious as Wimmering that his son should marry money; and from what he knew of Lord Oversley's circumstances Wimmering could not suppose that he either regarded with enthusiasm such an alliance. Miss Julia was an accredited Beauty; and if any man could have made an accurate guess at the extent of Lord Lynton's embarrassments it must have been his old friend Oversley No, Wimmering was inclined to think that his late lordship had been right when he had dismissed the affair as mere calf-love.<br><br></p><h2>Voyaging Under Power</h2><p>In World War II, aboard the aircraft carrier <i>Saratoga</i>, Captain Robert Beebe dreamed of one day retiring and cruising the world in a small boat. At that time world cruisers voyaged exclusively in sailboats. But sailboats are confined to narrow lanes of predominantly favorable winds, which can be unpredictable and difficult. Beebe wanted to arrive at distant ports relaxed and on time, not battered and two months late. He wanted to voyage under power.. <p>Back in the 1940s, no suitable long-distance powerboats existed. Beebe literally had to invent modern powerboat voyaging from scratch. The design parameters he developed for long-distance powerboats are still in use by naval architects today. The resulting boat, <i>Passagemaker</i>, was home to the Beebes for many years and more than 60,000 ocean-crossing miles. What Beebe learned in those years of voyaging became, in 1974, , still the most important and influential book ever published on long-distance powerboating.. </p><p>Now, under the able pen of world cruiser Jim Leishman, Beebe's classic <i>Voyaging Under Power</i> has received its first complete overhaul. The core of the book is vintage Beebe; his designs, his research, and his wonderful cruising stories remain intact. What's new are details of the advances of the intervening years: electronic wizardry for navigation and communication; efficient new engines that wring more miles out of a gallon of diesel fuel; active roll-prevention devices that virtually eliminate seasickness; propeller nozzles and bow thrusters that improve maneuverability and ease handling for short-handed crews; bulbous bow extensions that improve speed, fuel economy, and sea-keeping ability. There's an all-new section featuring the work of other designers, including George Buehler, Jay Benford, James Krogan, Jeff Leishman, Nils Lucander, Charles Neville, and Steven Seaton. Mrs. Beebe has thoroughly revised her original chapter on provisioning the long-distance galley, and there are several new chapters, including Inland Voyaging, which covers long-distance cruising on American inland waterways; Watch-Standing; and A Passagemaker's Machinery.. </p><p><i>Voyaging Under Power</i> is the definitive guide for those who yearn to expand their cruising horizons, and cross oceans with speed and comfort.</p></p><p>&#34;[A] &#39;must own,&#39; for anyone who dreams of, or plans, any long-distance powerboating, inland and off-shore. Anyone who is thinking motor cruise should read it three times.&#34;Captain Robert P. Beebe was a boy in the Philippines when his father gave him his first boat, a native canoe. Boats and ships remained at the core of his life. His thirty-year career in the U.S. Navy spanned two wars. Between tours of duty he studied naval architecture, designed boats, and wrote many articles for boating magazines. After World War II he became interested in ocean-going motorboats. Years of research led to <i>Passagemaker</i> and her voyage three-quarters of the way around the world--and ultimately, to this book.. . James F. Leishman is an experienced ocean voyager in his own right. His firm, Pacific Asian Enterprises, builds some of the finest long-distance voyaging craft--power or sail--available anywhere.</p><h2>The Road Winds On</h2><p>A winding path of self-examination -- the road winds on.

Since her first SF novels were published in the 1940s, her tales of action and adventure throughout the galaxy have drawn countless readers to science fiction. Her fantasy, including the best-selling Witch World series, has been popular with readers for decades. Andre Norton was the first woman to receive the Gandalf Grand Master of Fantasy Award, presented by the World Science Fiction Society in 1977 and the first woman to be named a Grand Master by the Science Fiction Writers of America in 1983.Hosteen Storm, a Navajo commando, must venture to the dangerously unstable planet of Arzor to kill a man he has never met. When he arrives, however, he discovers a more pressing issue to attend to, namely that the war he thought had ended may not be over at all. Narrator Richard Brewer reads with purpose, moving through the story at a steady pace that never lets up. As Storm, Brewer is more subdued than one would expect, but his approach makes the character more personal and believable. Brewer&#39;s driving performance allows listeners to empathize with their hero&#39;s plight and identify with its urgency.

His mother was a surgical/oncological gynecologist, his father a dermatologist, and his grandfather a Chinese herbalist. Dr. Han's pre-college education was mostly self-taught. At the age of eight, during China's Cultural Revolution, he was separated from his parents and sister. Unable to go to school, he continued his education on his own. The Cultural Revolution officially ended in 1976 with the death of Chairman Mao, and Dr. Han was admitted to the prestigious Beijing University of Chinese Medicine. From 1983 to 1985, he did a residency program in internal medicine in Beijing Dong Zhi Men Hospital, which specializes in the integration of Chinese and Western medicine. In September 1985, he was awarded one of two government scholarships to study psychology at the graduate level in the United States. Until June 1988, he studied clinical psychology and cognitive science at the University of California, and&nbsp;entered private practice in March 1989. He founded the Santa Barbara Herb and Wellness Center in 1998 and the Santa Barbara Herb Clinic in 1991. Over the years, Dr. Han treated thousands of patients and was recognized as a master herbalist and diagnostician.

In the early seventeenth century an Italian explorer and missionary had brought into China the book <b>Method of the West</b>, which had provided the first glimpse into Western medicine. <br><br>After that, Western medical literature was further introduced into China via Christian missionaries. Performing autopsies helped Dr. Wang verify some of the knowledge of anatomy that he had learned from his reading. Unlike his Western counterparts of that era who freely attended gross-anatomy classes, Dr. Wang was forced to work under a cloak of secrecy because of the Chinese cultural veneration for the body as a whole.<br><br>The restrictions Dr. Wang worked under began centuries earlier. The history of Chinese medicine reaches back to the dim and ancient past where the distinction between myth and historical facts is blurred, food and medicine were interchangeable and shamans, high priests, witches and doctors all provided medical care. Thousands of years before written language, the knowledge of Chinese medicine was passed through oral retelling of tales and legends.<br><br>The concept of wholeness in Chinese medicine took form through legendary discussions and dialogue between Emperor Huang Ti (the Yellow Emperor) and his physician Qi Bo (circa 2697 to 2205 b.c.). Nearly two thousand years later (circa 200 b.c.) Nei Jing, or The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine, was written down in eighteen volumes.3 It is said to contain the bulk of those discussions, including information on medicinal herbs, anatomy, medical theory, acupuncture, spirituality, life force, Yin and Yang. (Many of the major Chinese terms are capitalized throughout this book to define them as specific Chinese medical terms and in some cases to differentiate them from similar Western terms.) Nei Jing thoroughly explored the synergistic relationship between man and nature and health and illness to further define the concept of wholeness.<br><br>Taoism is a philosophical system derived chiefly from the Tao-te-ching, a book traditionally ascribed to Chinese philosopher Lao-tze but believed to have been written in the sixth century b.c. Taoism, a central influence of Chinese medicine, stated that "the heaven and the human are one" and described an ideal human condition of freedom from desire and of effortless simplicity, achieved by following the Tao (path)?the spontaneous, creative, effortless path taken by natural events in the universe. The notions of Qi (the life force) and Yin and Yang?which are the foundation of Chinese medicine?are inherited from Taoism.<br><br>In addition to these influences, within a hundred years of Confucius's death in 479 b.c., a system of ethics for the management of a well-ordered society began to develop from his teachings. So powerful was Confucius's influence that by the Han Dynasty (140 to 85 b.c.), Emperor Han Wu Di issued two decrees, "Banishment of all other schools" and "Favor only that of Confucianism," making Confucianism the sole official national philosophy and effectively forbidding all other social codes of behavior. One of Confucianism's main tenets was that the whole body was sacred and should remain complete throughout life and death.<br><br>Because of the veneration for the body as a whole, Confucianism opposed the practices of anatomical study and surgery, which would maim the body or corpse. These restrictions?which continued over many centuries?forced researchers such as Wang Qingren underground. While Western medicine continued delving into and learning from the human body's organs, tissues and bones in order to diagnose and treat illness, Chinese medicine evolved in the opposite direction, developing methods of diagnosis via external means such as observing, touching and listening to the patient.<br><br>In primitive times, throughout the world, disease was considered to be the result of a malevolent spell cast by an angered enemy, of displeasing a god or of inviting an evil spirit into one's body. Medicine consisted of magic and religious rites with witch doctors and sorcerers. For Western medicine, the transition from superstition to science was a gradual process, extending over centuries. When Greek physician Hippocrates, the so-called father of modern medicine, was born (circa 460 b.c.), medical thought had only partially discarded magic and religion as a basis for healing. As did the Chinese medical bible Nei Jing, Hippocrates rejected supernatural belief systems. He spoke disparagingly of the "charlatans and quacks" who perpetuated such beliefs and urged the exploration of disease as a natural phenomenon that could be observed and investigated. Like doctors of Chinese medicine, Hippocrates focused on the effects of food, occupation and environment in the development of disease. Understanding that mind and body were connected, he said, "Our natures are the physicians of our diseases." <br><br>But by the seventeenth century, French mathematician and philosopher Ren� Descartes introduced the premise that the body and the mind were entirely separate, which was quickly and heartily embraced by Western science as absolute truth. To explain why this premise was so readily accepted could take volumes of conjecture and discussion. Perhaps explaining the working of the human body, although incredibly daunting, at least seemed possible. To accept the mind as part of the system would have made the task virtually impossible. Another reason may have been that the mind seemed connected to the soul and, to the highly religious society of the day, separating the two was both logical and reverential.<br><br>Ancient Chinese, desiring to present themselves to their ancestors as whole, feared decapitation as capital punishment. This core reverence for the wholeness of the human being encouraged the development of a mind/body-oriented medicine. At the same time, due to the belief in the separation of mind and body, Western medicine proceeded to develop a "headless" medicine.<br><br>Western medicine generally revolved around folk medicine until scientific breakthroughs in human anatomy and physiology, knowledge of infectious agents, drugs and therapeutic procedures began to occur in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The discovery of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi led first to the germ theory of disease in the mid to late 1900s, which precipitated major scientific advancements. Continued advances have removed Western medicine far from its humble origins.<br><br>Unlike Western medicine's dramatic and exponentially exploding development, Chinese medicine has not needed to change very much from its original philosophy of wholeness and balance. One change that has begun to occur over the past two hundred years is Chinese medical doctors' interest in capitalizing on Western scientific knowledge and technologies. This change occurred very slowly and initially with great resistance.<br><br>When in 1830 Chinese doctor Wang Qingren used his newfound knowledge of human anatomy to write a book attempting to correct some erroneous assumptions of anatomy made by ancient Chinese scholars, critics accused him of magnifying confusion. Because the Western concept of physical organs does not have much significance in Chinese medicine, they said that it did not matter where the organs were located. At the same time, as Western medicine progressed, physicians and scientists viewed Chinese medicine as charlatanism and the notion of any kind of credibility was considered preposterous. This disdain from both sides kept the line drawn in the sand.<br><br>Integration, however, took on a life of its own and proceeded tenaciously, however haltingly. The first Western medical clinic was established in China in 1827, the first Western medical hospital in 1834. By the beginning of the twentieth century Western medical hospitals were starting to spring up in the larger cities. From the mid-nineteenth century to the early 1950s a rudimentary form of integrative medicine began to develop in China. Both Chinese and Western medicine were used, but in a side-by-side fashion instead of a truly combined, integrated use.<br><br>Unfortunately, one of the consequences of this approach is that those who were trained in Western medicine began to advocate the abandonment of Chinese medical theories entirely. They wanted to use Chinese herbs as Western doctors used drugs. In other words, they looked for effective herbs, isolated the active ingredients and extracted those from the natural substance to use only the isolated ingredient as Western medicine does. For example, in the 1920s the active ingredient, ephedrine, in the Chinese herb Ma Huang?which has been used in China for nearly four thousand years?was isolated and used to treat asthma and similar conditions. But this was not integration.<br><br>In his early seventies, Ke-ji Chen, M.D., is an internationally recognized authority on the integration of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine.4 "Until the early seventeenth century China had been decidedly more advanced technologically compared to the Western world," Dr. Chen said. In fact, by 1523 b.c. a writing system with two thousand characters was in use in China (in the West an alphabet emerged in Greece circa 800 b.c.). The Chinese discovered the orienting effect of lodestones, from which they pioneered the navigational compass around 101 b.c. In 105 b.c. a Chinese eunuch refined the process of papermaking. Gunpowder was believed to have originated in China in the ninth century. These are only some of the accomplishments by ancient Chinese. "But the momentum was lost around the early seventeenth century for cultural and historical reasons," Dr. Chen said. "When Europe emerged from the long dormancy of the Dark Ages, it was thrust forward through the Renaissance, which stimulated scientific knowledge and discoveries. In the meantime the deterioration?socially, culturally and scientifically?in China continued and culminated in a series of defeats by foreign powers that resulted in the collapse of the Ching Dynasty [1644 to 1908]. China's entrance to the modern era came with tremendous pain. China had had a brilliant past and civilization but had been left far behind."<br><br>By the turn of the twentieth century, the young and elite intellectuals of China took it upon themselves to redeem the country. "They were so pained and blinded by the humiliation and hurt pride that the country had suffered in the past several hundred years that they could not see anything valuable in Chinese tradition," Dr. Chen said. "In search of an answer they pondered what it was about the West that gave it power and vitality. A prevalent sentiment among the Chinese intellectuals was that it would best serve China to do away with tradition and adopt the ways of the West. It was against this background that the abandonment of Chinese medicine was proposed. The trend was so extreme that in the 1920s the nationalist government had banned Chinese medicine entirely. Within three months, the decision caused a tremendous outrage from the Chinese people of all classes, and the ban was lifted."<br><br>In 1949, Mao Tse-tung established the People's Republic of China. Seventeen years later, the turbulent political atmosphere erupted in the Cultural Revolution and the Red Terror swept over China. Those in power turned a blind eye as marauding bands of crazed teenagers pillaged the country, arresting and imprisoning high-ranking government officials and persecuting so-called intellectuals and antirevolutionaries. While most of China's culture was dismantled, by 1954 Chairman Mao Tse-tung officially recognized Chinese medicine as "the legacy of the motherland." From that point on, Chinese medicine was fully reinstated and endorsed by the government.<br><br>However, as a result of this influence, Chinese medicine evolved into two different schools. Traditional Chinese medicine continues to integrate mind, body and spirit in a true spiritual sense, relying on an ancient form of meditation called Qigong to build self-awareness, unity of mind and body and ultimately enlightenment. The school influenced by the Communist regime in China uses Chinese medical modalities such as herbal medicine and acupuncture in more of a nuts-and-bolts fashion. Eschewing a belief in spiritual unity, this more clinical practice of Chinese medicine views the mind/body connection in a more scientific and psychological manner.<br><br>Western medicine sees the human body as a collection of physical components such as bones, fluids, organs, tissues, cells, DNA and molecules. Chinese medicine does not delve into tangible components but rather views the body's patterns of Energy as part of a greater whole that is constantly in motion and constantly seeking balance. While the material dimension of a living being is made of the same elements that make up all tangible substances, what gives a living being life is the Energy within. Energy is formless, though we all know it exists. In Chinese medicine, the pattern of Energy within the body (and its environment) is referred to as Qi (pronounced chee). Broadly speaking, Qi is the integration of Yin and Yang. In other words, instead of being made up of materials, the human body is made up of Yin and Yang Energy?two opposing yet mutually dependent forces. Yin Energy is water, cool, calm, passive, and Yang Energy is fire, warm, active, aggressive.<br><br>Chinese medicine evolved from the belief that true health results from balancing the entire system. In Western thought the word system is thought of in compartmentalized terms, such as the system of the human body, the endocrine system, the nervous system and so on. Other examples are the solar system, Freud's system of psychological functioning (superego, ego and id), the U.S. system of government and a computer system. Chinese medicine considers human beings (who are composed of an interconnected mind and body) and their environment to be part of the same system, or part of a whole. Yin and Yang, and their constant fluctuations, dictate the balance of this whole. These constant fluctuations of Energy occur within a never-ending circle of nature, so that all occurrences have a consequence, sometimes positive and sometimes negative. Meridians are invisible channels in your body in which Qi (the integration of Yin and Yang Energies) flows. Meridians do not correspond to any known physiological structure in Western medicine. They are not like the Western concept of the circulation system, the nervous system or lymphatic system. Meridians are a complex web of channels that branch out to smaller and smaller meridian channels that become as minuscule as capillaries. Qi continually flows through these channels to create the wholeness of your body. Because Qi permeates the universe, Meridians connect your internal body with the outside universe as well.<br><br>In diagnosing and treating illness, Western medicine uses sophisticated scientific technologies to attempt to pinpoint the exact cause?whether it be bacterial, viral, cancerous cells or another tangible cause. Chinese medicine does not need to isolate tangible causes of disease in order to treat illness. From a Chinese medicine point of view, your Qi flows through the Meridian system of your body. Yin and Yang Energy form an infinite number of patterns within your body. For example, the Heart, Liver, Spleen, Kidneys and Lungs have individual Yin and Yang Energy.

Siddhartha is perhaps the most important and compelling moral allegory our troubled century has produced. Integrating Eastern and Western spiritual traditions with psychoanalysis and philosophy, this strangely simple tale, written with a deep and moving empathy for humanity, has touched the lives of millions since its original publication in 1922. Set in India, Siddhartha is the story of a young Brahmin&#39;s search for ultimate reality after meeting with the Buddha. His quest takes him from a life of decadence to asceticism, from the illusory joys of sensual love with a beautiful courtesan, and of wealth and fame, to the painful struggles with his son and the ultimate wisdom of renunciation. Hermann Hesse (1877-1962) suffered from depression, endured criticism for his pacifist views, and weathered series of personal crises which led him to undergo psychoanalysis with J. B. Lang; a process which resulted in Demian (1919), a novel whose main character is torn between the orderliness of bourgeois existence and the turbulent and enticing world of sensual experience. This dichotomy is prominent in Hesse&#39;s subsequent novels, including Siddhartha (1922), Steppenwolf (1927), Narcissus and Goldmund (1930) and his magnum opus, The Glass Bead Game (1943). Hesse was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1946. Paulo Coelho was born in Brazil and has become one of the most widely read authors in the world. Especially renowned for The Alchemist and Eleven Minutes, he has sold more than 100 million books worldwide and has been translated into 66 languages. If you enjoyed Siddhartha, you might like Hesse&#39;s Steppenwolf, also available in Penguin Classics.</p><p>One of the most influential writers of our time, Paulo Coelho is the author of many international best sellers, including Adultery, The Alchemist, Aleph, Eleven Minutes and Manuscript Found in Accra. Translated into eighty languages, his books have sold more than 195 million copies in more than 170 countries. He is a member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters and has received the Chevalier de l&#39;Ordre National de la L�gion d&#39;Honneur. In 2007, he was named a United Nations Messenger of Peace.Chapter 1<br><br> The Son of the Brahmin<br><br> In the shade of the house, in the sunlight on the riverbank where the boats were moored, in the shade of the sal wood and the shade of the fig tree, Siddhartha grew up, the Brahmin&#x2019;s handsome son, the young falcon, together with his friend Govinda, the son of a Brahmin. Sunlight darkened his fair shoulders on the riverbank as he bathed, performed the holy ablutions, the holy sacrifices. Shade poured into his dark eyes in the mango grove as he played with the other boys, listened to his mother&#x2019;s songs, performed the holy sacrifices, heard the teachings of his learned father and the wise men&#x2019;s counsels. Siddhartha had long since begun to join in the wise men&#x2019;s counsels, to practice with Govinda the art of wrestling with words, to practice with Govinda the art of contemplation, the duty of meditation. He had mastered Om, the Word of Words, learned to speak it soundlessly into himself while drawing a breath, to speak it out soundlessly as his breath was released, his soul collected, brow shining with his mind&#x2019;s clear thought. He had learned to feel Atman&#x2019;s presence at the core of his being, inextinguishable, one with the universe.<br><br> Joy leaped into his father&#x2019;s heart at the thought of his son, this studious boy with his thirst for knowledge; he envisioned him growing up to be a great wise man and priest, a prince among Brahmins.<br><br> Delight leaped into his mother&#x2019;s breast when she beheld him, watched him as he walked and sat and stood, Siddhartha, the strong handsome boy walking on slender legs, greeting her with flawless grace.<br><br> Love stirred in the hearts of the young Brahmin girls when Siddhartha walked through the streets of their town with his radiant brow, his regal eye, his narrow hips.<br><br> But none of them loved him more dearly than Govinda, his friend, the Brahmin&#x2019;s son. He loved Siddhartha&#x2019;s eyes and his sweet voice, loved the way he walked and the flawless grace of his movements; he loved all that Siddhartha did and all he said and most of all he loved his mind, his noble, passionate thoughts, his ardent will, his noble calling. Govinda knew: This would be no ordinary Brahmin, no indolent pen pusher overseeing the sacrifices, no greedy hawker of incantations, no vain, shallow orator, no wicked, deceitful priest, and no foolish, good sheep among the herd of the multitude. Nor did he, Govinda, have any intention of becoming such a creature, one of the tens of thousands of ordinary Brahmins. His wish was to follow Siddhartha, the beloved, splendid one. And if Siddhartha should ever become a god, if he were ever to take his place among the Radiant Ones, Govinda wished to follow him, as his friend, his companion, his servant, his spear bearer, his shadow.<br><br> Thus was Siddhartha beloved by all. He brought them all joy, filled them with delight.<br><br> To himself, though, Siddhartha brought no joy, gave no delight. Strolling along the rosy pathways of the fig garden, seated in the blue-tinged shade of the Grove of Contemplation, washing his limbs in the daily expiatory baths, performing sacrifices in the deep-shadowed mango wood, with his gestures of flawless grace, he was beloved by all, a joy to all, yet was his own heart bereft of joy. Dreams assailed him, and troubled thoughts&#x2014;eddying up from the waves of the river, sparkling down from the stars at night, melting out of the sun&#x2019;s rays; dreams came to him, and a disquiet of the soul wafting in the smoke from the sacrifices, murmuring among the verses of the Rig-Veda, welling up in the teachings of the old Brahmins.<br><br> Siddhartha had begun to harbor discontent. He had begun to feel that his father&#x2019;s love and the love of his mother, even the love of his friend Govinda, would not always and forever suffice to gladden him, content him, sate him, fulfill him. He had begun to suspect that his venerable father and his other teachers, all wise Brahmins, had already given him the richest and best part of their wisdom, had already poured their plenty into his waiting vessel, yet the vessel was not full: His mind was not content, his soul not at peace, his heart restless. The ablutions were good, but they were only water; they could not wash away sin, could not quench his mind&#x2019;s thirst or dispel his heart&#x2019;s fear. The sacrifices and the invocations of the gods were most excellent&#x2014;but was this all? Did the sacrifices bring happiness? And what of the gods? Was it really Prajapati who had created the world? Was it not rather Atman, He, the Singular, the One and Only? Weren&#x2019;t the gods mere shapes, creations like you and me, subject to time, transitory? And was it then good, was it proper, was it meaningful, a noble act, to sacrifice to the gods? To whom else should one sacrifice, to whom else show devotion, if not to Him, the Singular, Atman? And where was Atman to be found, where did He reside, where did His eternal heart lie beating? Where else but within oneself, in the innermost indestructible core each man carries inside him. But where, where was this Self, this innermost, utmost thing? It was not flesh and bone, it was not thought and not consciousness, at least according to the wise men&#x2019;s teachings. Where was it then, where? To penetrate to this point, to reach the Self, oneself, Atman&#x2014;could there be any other path worth seeking? Yet this was a path no one was showing him; it was a path no one knew, not his father, not the teachers and wise men, not the holy songs intoned at the sacrifices! They knew everything, these Brahmins and their holy books, everything, and they had applied themselves to everything, more than everything: to the creation of the world, the origins of speech, of food, of inhalation and exhalation; to the orders of the senses, the deeds of the gods&#x2014;they knew infinitely many things&#x2014;but was there value in knowing all these things without knowing the One, the Only thing, that which was important above all else, that was, indeed, the sole matter of importance?<br><br> To be sure, many verses in the holy books, above all the Upanishads of the Sama-Veda, spoke of this innermost, utmost thing: splendid verses. &#x201c;Your soul is the entire world&#x201d; was written there, and it was written as well that in sleep, the deepest sleep, man entered the innermost core of his being and dwelt in Atman. There was glorious wisdom in these verses; all the knowledge of the wisest men was collected here in magic words, pure as the honey collected by bees. It was not to be disregarded, this massive sum of knowledge that had been collected here by countless generations of wise Brahmins.<br><br> But where were the Brahmins, where the priests, where the wise men or penitents who had succeeded not merely in knowing this knowledge but in living it? Where was the master who had been able to transport his own being-at-home-in-Atman from sleep to the waking realm, to life, to all his comings and goings, his every word and deed?<br><br> Siddhartha knew a great many venerable Brahmins, above all his father, a pure, learned, utterly venerable man. Worthy of admiration was his father, still and regal his bearing, his life pure, his words full of wisdom; fine and noble thoughts resided in his brow. But even he, who was possessed of such knowledge, did he dwell in bliss, did he know peace? Was not he too only a seeker, a man tormented by thirst? Was he not compelled to drink again and again from the holy springs, a thirsty man drinking in the sacrifices, the books, the dialogues of the Brahmins? Why must he, who was without blame, wash away sin day after day, labor daily to cleanse himself, each day anew? Was not Atman within him? Did not the ancient source of all springs flow within his own heart? This was what must be found, the fountainhead within one&#x2019;s own being; you had to make it your own! All else was searching, detour, confusion.<br><br> Such was the nature of Siddhartha&#x2019;s thoughts; this was his thirst, this his sorrow.<br><br> Often he recited to himself the words of a Chandogya Upanishad: &#x201c;Verily, the name of the Brahman is Satyam; truly, he who knows this enters each day into the heavenly world.&#x201d; It often seemed near at hand, this heavenly world, but never once had he succeeded in reaching it, in quenching that final thirst. And of all the wise and wisest men he knew and whose teachings he enjoyed, not a single one had succeeded in reaching it, this heavenly world; not one had fully quenched that eternal thirst.<br><br> &#x201c;Govinda,&#x201d; Siddhartha said to his friend. &#x201c;Govinda, beloved one, come under the banyan tree with me; let us practice samadhi.&#x201d;<br><br> To the banyan they went and sat down beneath it, Siddhartha here and Govinda at a distance of twenty paces. As he sat down, ready to speak the Om, Siddhartha murmured this verse:<br><br> &#x201c;Om is the bow; the arrow is soul.<br><br> Brahman is the arrow&#x2019;s mark;<br><br> Strike it with steady aim.&#x201d;<br><br> When the usual time for the meditation exercise had passed, Govinda arose. Evening had come; it was time to begin the ablutions of the eventide. He called Siddhartha&#x2019;s name; Siddhartha gave no answer. Siddhartha sat rapt, his eyes fixed unmoving upon a far distant point; the tip of his tongue stuck out from between his teeth; he seemed not to be breathing. Thus he sat, cloaked in samadhi, thinking Om, his soul an arrow on its way to Brahman.<br><br> One day, Samanas passed through Siddhartha&#x2019;s town: ascetic pilgrims, three gaunt lifeless men, neither old nor young, with bloody, dust-covered shoulders, all but naked, singed by the sun, shrouded in isolation, foreign to the world and hostile to it, strangers and wizened jackals among men. The hot breath of air that followed them bore the scent of silent passion, a duty that meant destruction, the merciless eradication of ego.<br><br> In the evening, when the hour of contemplation had passed, Siddhartha said to Govinda, &#x201c;Tomorrow morning, my friend, Siddhartha will go to the Samanas. He will become a Samana.&#x201d;<br><br> Govinda turned pale when he heard these words and saw in his friend&#x2019;s impassive face a resolve as unwavering as an arrow shot from the bow. At once, with a single glance, Govinda realized: Now it is beginning, now Siddhartha is on his way, now his destiny is beginning to bud and, along with it, mine as well. And he turned as pale as a dried-out banana peel.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, Siddhartha,&#x201d; he cried, &#x201c;will your father permit this?&#x201d;<br><br> Siddhartha glanced over at him like a man awakening. Swift as an arrow he read Govinda&#x2019;s soul, read the fear, read the devotion.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, Govinda,&#x201d; he said softly, &#x201c;let us not squander words. Tomorrow at daybreak I begin the life of a Samana. Speak no more of it.&#x201d;<br><br> Siddhartha went into the room where his father was seated upon a mat made of bast fiber; he came up behind him and remained standing there until his father felt there was someone behind him. &#x201c;Is that you, Siddhartha?&#x201d; the Brahmin said. &#x201c;Then say what you have come here to say.&#x201d;<br><br> Said Siddhartha, &#x201c;With your permission, my father. I have come to tell you that it is my wish to leave your house tomorrow and join the ascetics. I must become a Samana. May my father not be opposed to my wish.&#x201d;<br><br> The Brahmin was silent and remained silent so long that the stars drifted in the small window and changed their shape before the silence in the room reached its end. Mute and motionless stood the son with his arms crossed, mute and motionless upon his mat sat the father, and the stars moved across the sky. Then the father said, &#x201c;It is not fitting for a Brahmin to utter sharp, angry words. But my heart is filled with displeasure. I do not wish to hear this request from your lips a second time.&#x201d;<br><br> Slowly the Brahmin rose to his feet. Siddhartha stood in silence with his arms crossed.<br><br> &#x201c;Why do you wait here?&#x201d; the father asked.<br><br> &#x201c;You know why I wait,&#x201d; Siddhartha replied.<br><br> Full of displeasure, the father left the room; full of displeasure, he went to his bed and lay down.<br><br> An hour later, as no sleep would enter his eyes, the Brahmin got up, paced back and forth, and went out of the house. He looked through the small window of the room and saw Siddhartha standing there, his arms crossed, unmoving. The light cloth of his tunic was shimmering pale. His heart full of disquiet, the father went back to bed.<br><br> An hour later, as no sleep would yet enter his eyes, the Brahmin got up once more, paced back and forth, and went out of the house. The moon had risen. He looked through the window into the room; there stood Siddhartha, unmoving, his arms crossed, moonlight gleaming on his bare shins. His heart full of apprehension, the father returned to bed.<br><br> An hour later, and again two hours later, he went out and looked through the small window to see Siddhartha standing there: in the moonlight, in the starlight, in the darkness. He went again from hour to hour, in silence, looked into the room, and saw his son standing there unmoving, and his heart filled with anger, with disquiet, with trepidation, with sorrow.<br><br> And in the last hour of night before day began, he got up once more, went into the room, and saw the youth standing there; he looked tall to him and like a stranger.<br><br> &#x201c;Siddhartha,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;why do you wait here?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You know why.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Will you remain standing here, waiting, until day comes, noon comes, evening comes?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I will remain standing here, waiting.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You will grow tired, Siddhartha.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I will grow tired.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You will fall asleep, Siddhartha.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I will not fall asleep.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You will die, Siddhartha.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I will die.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;And you would rather die than obey your father?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Siddhartha has always obeyed his father.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;So you will give up your plan?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Siddhartha will do as his father instructs him.&#x201d;<br><br> The first light of day fell into the room. The Brahmin saw that Siddhartha&#x2019;s knees were trembling quietly. In Siddhartha&#x2019;s face he saw no trembling; his eyes gazed into the distance straight before him. The father realized then that Siddhartha was no longer with him in the place of his birth. His son had already left him behind.<br><br> The father touched Siddhartha&#x2019;s shoulder.<br><br> &#x201c;You will go,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Go to the forest and be a Samana. If you find bliss in the forest, come and teach it to me. If you find disappointment, return to me and we will once more sacrifice to the gods side by side. Now go and kiss your mother; tell her where you are going. It is time for me to go to the river and begin my first ablutions.&#x201d;<br><br> He took his hand from his son&#x2019;s shoulder and went out. Siddhartha lurched to one side when he tried to walk. Forcing his limbs into submission, he bowed before his father and went to find his mother to do as his father had instructed.<br><br> In the first light of dawn, as he was slowly leaving the town on his stiff legs, a shadow rose up beside the last hut, a shadow that had been crouching there and now joined the pilgrim: Govinda.<br><br> &#x201c;You came,&#x201d; said Siddhartha, and smiled.<br><br> &#x201c;I came,&#x201d; Govinda said.</p><h2>Bauhaus (World of Art)</h2><p><p><strong>Traces the history of the German school of art, the Bauhaus, and examines the activities of its teachers and students.</strong></p></p><p>Frank Whitford was born in 1941 and educated at Wadham College, Oxford, the Courtauld Institute, London and the Freie Universitat, West Berlin. After a career as a journalist and a cartoonist, he taught at University College London, and then in Cambridge, where he is still attached to Wolfson College. Well known as a broadcaster and lecturer, he was for many years Tutor in Cultural History at the Royal College of Art, London. His other books include Klimt and Bauhaus (also in the World of Art Series); Oskar Kokoschka, A Life; Expressionist Paintings and the prize-winning Japanese Prints and Western Painters.Founded in 1919 in Weimar Germany amidst unparalleled economic and political chaos, the Bauhaus design school broke down barriers between fine arts, crafts and industry. British art historian Whitford here gathers Bauhaus participants' diaries, letters, manifestos and essays from journals, exhibition catalogues and newspapers, including much material never before translated into English. Through writings by Walter Gropius, Wassily Kandinsky, Gunta Stolzl, Mies van der Rohe, Anni Alberts, Paul Klee, Lyonel Feininger and others, we witness the clashes of personality and of ideas that fueled the institute's creative ferment and follow its continual struggle for survival, which ended with the Berlin branch shut down by the Gestapo in 1933. More than 230 illustrations re-create the Bauhaus's innovations in painting, architecture, lithographs, typography, textiles, kinetic sculpture, metalware, furniture, pottery and costume design. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Journal of Wong Ming-Chung: A Chinese Miner, California, 1852 (My Name is America)</h2><p>A young Chinese boy nicknamed Runt records his experiences in a journal as he travels from southern China to California in 1852 to join his uncle during the Gold Rush.</p><p>It is 1852, and 10-year-old Wong Ming-Chung, or Bright Intelligence--or Runt, as he is most commonly called--has arrived at the gold mines of California after a dangerous journey from China. Exchanging the famine and war of his native country for the brutal bullies and grueling labor in America, Runt joins his uncle and countless others in the effort to strike it rich on the great "Golden Mountain." Unfortunately, he, and most of the rest of the dreamers, soon discover that there's no such thing as a Golden Mountain, only dirt, mud, and tiny, occasional flecks of gold dust--flecks that are to be turned over to the owners of the mines, in return for barely livable wages. However, someone as clever and resourceful as Runt can still find true opportunity in this land. He and his uncle team up to find ingenious new ways of making money, and to defend themselves against the bitter, racist white Americans. Along the way, Runt develops lasting friendships with many people from all over the world, learning ways to communicate with them in spite of cultural and language differences. <p> A thoroughly engrossing addition to the Dear America series, this historical fiction is written in the form of a diary.

In addition, Alan created the popular and successful Little Rabbits series, which has sold over half-a-million copies in the U.S. Alan is a lecturer in illustration at the University of Brighton, England.Each of these innovative concept books adds an extra dimension to the usual lessons about letters, colors, shapes and numbers. ABC , like so many other alphabet books, starts out with an apple, but then departs from the expected: the familiar fruit becomes the subject of Black and White Rabbit's painting in a wry and often very messy journey from A to Z. 1,2,3 combines a counting lesson with animal identification (and more art) as Gray Rabbit molds piles of colored clay into a variety of figures. In Shape , Brown Rabbit investigates the contents of a brightly wrapped package. White Rabbit, in Color , shows off the mixable properties of the primary colors when she immerses herself in three big tubs of paint.

The last few children in blue-and-white uniforms have finished their after-school work and are plodding along in small gangs or, like her, alone. They don't take notice of her; they have screens in their hands, shoves and teasing to repay, snacks bagged in newsprint to grease up their fingers. In their trail, sparrows tussle over fallen fried crumbs and biscuit sticks trampled to powder by little shoes. A pearl-eyed lottery seller, sensing passersby from footsteps and the clap of flip-flops, calls out over an opened case of clothes-pinned tickets to whoever craves luck.<br><br>Her nose picks up the ashen smell always in the air. Somewhere, a garbage heap incinerates underneath a highway overpass; in temples, incense sticks release sweet smoke to the holy and the dead; flames curl blue in the open-air gas grills of shophouse food stalls.<br><br>She is a child or a few thousand years old. Would it ever matter? The city will stay this way for her. When she was a uniformed primary schooler herself, walking home along these very streets, she liked to make believe she was a bewildered traveler in a foreign city, drawn forward by alluring strangeness. She couldn't have known then that there would be years ahead when she didn't have to pretend, and years still further ahead when pretending was all she could do.<br><br>Fresh, fresh, hot, hot, good for kids, delicious for grown-ups, twenty bahts, twenty bahts. She counts on hearing the soy milk lady's singsongy cry ahead of the others. The thicker the crowd on the sidewalk, the louder the hawkers call out. Stampedes of dusty shoes and shopping bags and stray dogs crisscross near the ground; canopies of sun-shielding umbrellas and twisty headphone cords drift above. The fruit sellers have laid parrot-green pyramids of pomelo on their tables. They holler, "Come, pretty young sister! Come sample this!" and she tells them maybe tomorrow, knowing they'll be at the same spot to greet her the next morning as she hurries to catch the 6:45 at the Skytrain station. Auntie Tofu, Uncle Big Mouth, the Egret: she doesn't know their real names, only the monikers her mother mentioned when boasting of discounts negotiated at the produce scale. The vendors pick up halved mangosteens to show off the white flesh balled inside like an unbloomed flower. It's about the time of the year when these particular fruits become more plentiful, though that wasn't always the case, especially during the calamitous years-lifetimes ago it seems-when orchards drowned and few trucks dared brave watery roads to deliver what little of the crop had been saved. Those days are hardly worth remembering, are they? Everything is now back in its place.<br><br>The asphalt before her darkens in the shadow of the building she thinks of as home. The usual guard salutes her from the gatehouse, a walkie-talkie raised to his forehead. When building management first upgraded the security setup to attract higher-paying tenants for the rental floors, she thought the cameras were turning to follow her. She'd find out that the motion was simply an automatic preset and the feeds went to backroom monitors attended by no one. She was young then and didn't realize that there was already scant escape from being watched, camera or no camera.<br><br>Eyes are everywhere, pointing down from balconies and windows, through the iron fencing and palm thickets that separate the building's grounds from the unruly street. She can feel eyes on her skin, even now. It won't surprise her to turn around from this walk up the driveway and find the guard peeling her with his stare. Where the building's communal shrine stands, a sun-reddened European family, probably one of the short-term renters, is clicking selfies in front of the week's offerings-oranges and bottled cola-for higher entities and land spirits. The pudgy-faced father turns in her direction, eyes widened, before resuming his pose for another shot.<br><br>In the lobby, chilled, purified air welcomes her. How many times has she walked over these granite tiles? Always in a rush, out and in. No letting up the pace. There isn't need for any hurry now. She can take the remainder of her life, if she wants. As she passes, the receptionist behind the front desk barely glances at her, occupied by the telenovela playing on a small tablet that slides out from under her folders when the manager isn't around. There's no customer at the coffee nook, where the receptionist also triples as barista and cashier should someone obey the beckoning paw of the Japanese porcelain cat on the counter.<br><br>The coffee venture was part of a flurry of renovations management had embarked upon after she left for abroad. One year, she'd returned to find the lobby's gray walls covered up by prefabricated panels of exposed brick and the waiting area's threadbare sofa replaced by sleeker Scandinavian-by-way-of-Thai-factories chaises and sectionals. Another visit, a spa meant for expats and tourists had opened on one end of the ground floor, and the music from the lobby's overhead speakers had switched from Thai pop hits to rain forest sounds laid over tinkling chimes. Even the elevator bank had gotten a makeover, with footlights installed along the walls and the nicked beige doors refashioned with a few coats of auspicious firecracker red for the Chinese renters.<br><br>She stops in front of the call button, her hands clenched. Maybe this will be the time she gives in to the temptation to push it and wait for the arrival bell, a sound she has heard thousands of times. It's nearly seven o'clock. Both her parents should be home from work. Her father's probably watering the plants on the balcony and doing his evening calisthenics routine-arms swinging and legs lifting-in the Premier League T-shirt and shorts he has changed into, and her mother's probably in her favorite chair by the window, arms spreading and folding the day-old newspaper that she always forgets to take for her train commute. Soup is simmering on the stove in the alcove kitchen. It's either the lotus stem curry that her father brings home twice a week from his favorite shop by his office, or the clear tofu soup he likes to make with vegetables left over from other dishes. The TV is on, as it usually is. To break the silence, as her mother says. The evening news anchors-always the genial pairing of a delicately featured woman and a bespectacled man-are at their desk, pitying the fallen and wounded in the day's roundup. At some point, her mother gets up to knock at the windows to tell her father to come inside. Her father pretends to ignore the knock, and her mother knocks again, with louder authority.<br><br>The ding of the bell stiffens her back. The elevator has arrived on its own. Its red doors slide open with no one inside, and her own eyes return her gaze from the mirrored wall inside. She dares herself to step through.<br><br>She should have known this already: she won't. She'll turn around and walk out the door at the rear of the building and onto the covered walkway leading to the pool. It will already be growing darker out there, no one to look up at the scatter of lit windows. She'll just slip out and leave, as she has always done.<br><br>Before she can decide, something interrupts her. She can't say what it is-not a thing she can see, but different from a mere thought, and more than a feeling. It approaches her, cresting forcefully like a wave that has rippled across oceans. It wakes her, as if she were being shaken out of a dream. This is no dream. It's gathering outside of her. It speaks and says without speaking. A dreadful thing's about to happen.<br><br>She squints out the lobby's windows. A dry-cleaning delivery van cruises down the drive, the hanger bags having been dropped off. That's all it probably was: a noisy engine startling an anxious woman. She wonders if any of the others also felt it. In the lobby, the receptionist sits undisturbed, her attention still with the telenovela. A tenant stands at the wall of mailboxes, flipping through envelopes. From the speakers, recorded jungle birds squawk out over a synthesized human choir. Her steps clap forward across the marble floor. She pushes the glass doors into the remaining warmth of the slow-boiled day.<br><br>It is only so. Many times exiting through these doors, she mumbles the words: It is only so. It's a phrase she's said since she was barely more than a child, to steel herself for the unknowable day. A swim teacher first said it to her during a lesson, after a sparrow that had broken its neck against a sky-filled window fell dead into the pool, and she clung to the words as if they were a lifeline thrown to her. It is only so. She repeats the phrase three times, out of habit and a need to calm herself, not knowing why she's pacing the circular driveway, looking for what she can't even say.<br><br>She suspects the guard is watching her again but doesn't turn around to check. Following the seeming tilt of the land, she lets her feet pull her like hounds toward the garden by the garage entrance, where drivers wait their turn to whirl down the window and tap their entry card. She has long avoided this area for the good chance of running into one of her parents behind the wheel of a car.<br><br>The garden is nothing more than a square of yellowing grass and concrete planters. The air here feels thinned out. Her own footsteps, echoing back one, two, one, two, feel faded against an intensifying gradient of sensation.<br><br>She's suddenly reminded of the few minutes before a concert begins, when musicians run through their warm-ups onstage. She loves hearing those first discordant notes climbing and collapsing in their collective routine as much as the program to come. What are these instruments that now play for her? She hears the flapping of a buzzard's wings, monsoon rain tapping on window glass. Song of harvest sounding across rice fields. Monks' prayers enveloping a hall of mourners. A hand bounding sharply past middle C.<br><br>Some uproar above compels her to look up. She sees only the infinity of the bluing cloudless dusk and the darkened rise of the building, but her instincts command her to cross her arms overhead, turn away, and brace.</p><h2>Demon, Volume 4 (Demon, 4)</h2><p><p><b>Volume 1 was an Eisner Award winner and<i> LA Times</i> Book Prize finalist!</b><br><b></b><br>Immortal actuary Jimmy makes a startling discovery: Agent Hunter, his long-dead adversary, is actually alive and a demon himself!

F. Skinner, an American behavioral psychologist, is known for his many contributions to learning theory. His Behavior of Organisms (1938) reports his experiments with the study of reflexes. Walden Two (1949), a utopian novel, describes a planned community in which positive rather than negative reinforcers serve to maintain appropriate behavior; the novel stimulated the founding of some experimental communities. In Beyond Freedom and Dignity (1971), Skinner attempted to show that only what he called a technology of behavior could save democracy from the many individual and social problems that plague it. (An early example of this technology is the so-called Skinner box for conditioning a human child.) A teacher at Harvard University from 1948 until his retirement, Skinner was for some the model of the objective scientist, for others the epitome of the heartless behaviorist who would turn people into automatons.</p><h2>Eat for Health</h2><p>As one of the country&#39;s leading experts on nutritional and natural healing, Dr. Joel Fuhrman has been featured in hundreds of magazines and on major radio and TV shows, including: Good Morning America, CNN, Good Day New York, The Food Network, and the Discovery Channel&#39;s Second Opinion with Dr. Oz.

This is an area of little water, lots of slickrock sandstone, soaring cliffs, upturned geologic formations and slot canyons. <p> This all-new 3rd Edition of the book that first came out in 1986, has been expanded from 160 to 224 pages, and there are about 90 more fotographs than in the 2nd Edition. This edition still has all the hikes from previous printings, but each has been re-visited and updated. The author re-walked most of the canyons. The biggest changes for this 3rd Edition is the addition of 8 technical slot canyons where you'll need ropes and rappelling gear to get all the way through. These canyons are either bolted, or have slings around chokestones for easy rappelling (usless the anchors have been washed away!). This means a new level of challenge and excitment for the adventurous hiker.

Mark Twain reflects, "I like a thin book because it will steady a table, a leather volume because it will strop a razor, and a heavy book because it can be thrown at a cat." And Fran Lebowitz notes that "Magazines all too frequently lead to books, and should be regarded by the prudent as the heavy petting of literature." Aristotle observes that "To write well, express yourself like the common people, but think like a wise man." H.L. Mencken explains, "I write in order to attain that feeling of tension relieved and function achieved, which a cow enjoys on giving milk." And Thomas Mann opines that "A writer is somebody for whom writing is more difficult than it is for other people."</p><p> In all, there are more than 500 quotations that pithily consider every aspect of authors, readers, collectors, and books.

Jerome A. Jackson provides detailed insights into the bird's lifestyle, habitat, and cultural significance, examining its iconic status from the late 1800s to the present in advertising, conservation, and lore. As he relates searches for the bird by John James Audubon, Alexander Wilson, and others, Jackson offers anecdotal tales illuminating the methods of early naturalists, including how Wilson's captive ivory-bill destroys his hotel room in a desperate attempt to escape. Jackson's search for perhaps the last remaining ivory-bill takes him across the United States and into Cuba. He spends hours flying over potential ivory-bill habitat, canoeing through isolated waterways, and trudging through swamps, always playing recorded ivory-bill calls into the wilderness, hoping for a response. 30 halftones.</p></p><p><b>Jerome A. Jackson</b> is editor of <i>Grizmek's Animal Life Encyclopedia: Birds, Second Edition</i> and is the Whitaker Eminent Scholar in Science at Florida Gulf Coast University. He lives in Naples, Florida.With its large bill and impressive appearance, the ivory-billed woodpecker, long thought to be extinct, is an ornithologist's holy grail. Organizations have sponsored searches for it; nature Web sites ask visitors to e-mail in their ivory-billed reports; and flocks of hopeful birders descend upon the American South every year hoping to find one. Jackson is a leading scholar and dedicated knight of this impressive bird, having maintained an obsession with it for 30 years. He takes readers on his exhaustive search through history books and records and then on his tireless travels in southeastern America and Cuba looking for the ivory-billed. In a time of multitasking and overwhelming choices, Jackson's life, with its single-minded pursuit, is enviable, and the book's allure derives in part from Jackson's zeal and focus. He provides insight into the interdependence of flora and fauna of the ivory-billed woodpecker's habitat; extensive background on previous ornithologists' work; the woodpecker's history (going back to its possible evolution two million years ago); and the bird's iconography in preservation and even advertising (in Travelers Insurance Company ads and elsewhere). With diligence and exacting scholarship, Jackson makes an important contribution to our understanding of this elusive bird and the impact of human activities on its environment. 30 halftones. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

What crucial knowledge would they need to survive in the immediate aftermath and to rebuild civilization as quickly as possible&#x2014;a guide for rebooting the world?<p><br>Human knowledge is collective, distributed across the population. It has built on itself for centuries, becoming vast and increasingly specialized. Most of us are ignorant about the fundamental principles of the civilization that supports us, happily utilizing the latest&#x2014;or even the most basic&#x2014;technology without having the slightest idea of why it works or how it came to be. If you had to go back to absolute basics, like some sort of postcataclysmic Robinson Crusoe, would you know how to re-create an internal combustion engine, put together a microscope, get metals out of rock, accurately tell time, weave fibers into clothing, or even how to produce food for yourself?</p><p><br>Regarded as one of the brightest young scientists of his generation, Lewis Dartnell proposes that the key to preserving civilization in an apocalyptic scenario is to provide a quickstart guide, adapted to cataclysmic circumstances.&nbsp;<i>The Knowledge</i>&nbsp;describes many of the modern technologies we employ, but first it explains the fundamentals upon which they are built. Every piece of technology rests on an enormous support network of other technologies, all interlinked and mutually dependent. You can&#x2019;t hope to build a radio, for example, without understanding how to acquire the raw materials it requires, as well as generate the electricity needed to run it. But Dartnell doesn&#x2019;t just provide specific information for starting over; he also reveals the greatest invention of them all&#x2014;the phenomenal knowledge-generating machine that is the scientific method itself. This would allow survivors to learn technological advances not explicitly explored in&nbsp;<i>The Knowledge</i>&nbsp;as well as things we have yet to discover.</p><p><br><i>The Knowledge</i>&nbsp;is a brilliantly original guide to the fundamentals of science and how it built our modern world as well as a thought experiment about the very idea of scientific knowledge itself.</p></p><p>Lewis Dartnell is a UK Space Agency research fellow at the University of Leicester, working in the field of astrobiology and the search for microbial life on Mars. The author of Life in the Universe and My Tourist Guide to the Solar System, he has won several awards for his science writing and outreach work.<p></p><p></p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT HAS ENDED.</p><p>A particularly virulent strain of avian flu finally breached the species barrier and hopped successfully to human hosts, or was deliberately released in an act of bioterrorism. The contagion spread devastatingly quickly in the modern age of high-density cities and intercontinental air travel, and killed a large proportion of the global population before any effective immunization or even quarantine orders could be implemented.</p><p>Or tensions between India and Pakistan reached the breaking point and a border dispute escalated beyond all rational limits, culminating in the use of nuclear weapons. The warheads&#x2019; distinctive electromagnetic pulses were detected by defense surveillance in China and triggered a round of preemptive launches against the United States, which in turn spurred retaliatory strikes by America and its allies in Europe and Israel. Major cities worldwide were reduced to jagged plains of radioactive glass. The enormous volumes of dust and ash injected into the atmosphere reduced the amount of sunlight reaching the ground, causing a decades-long nuclear winter, the collapse of agriculture, and global famine.</p><p>Or the event was entirely beyond human control. A rocky asteroid, only around a mile across, slammed into the Earth and fatally changed atmospheric conditions. People within a few hundred kilometers of ground zero were dispatched in an instant by the blast wave of intense heat and pressure, and from that point on most of the rest of humanity was living on borrowed time. It didn&#x2019;t really matter which nation was struck: the rock and dust hurled up high into the atmosphere&#x2014;as well as the smoke produced by widespread fires ignited by the heat blast&#x2014;dispersed on the winds to smother the entire planet. As in a nuclear winter, global temperatures dropped enough to cause worldwide crop failures and massive famine.</p><p>This is the stuff of so many novels and films featuring post-apocalyptic worlds. The immediate aftermath is often&#x2014;as in <i>Mad Max</i> or Cormac McCarthy&#x2019;s novel <i>The Road</i>&#x2014;portrayed as barren and violent. Roving bands of scavengers hoard the remaining food and prey ruthlessly on those less well organized or armed. I suspect that, at least for a period after the initial shock of collapse, this might not be too far from the truth. I&#x2019;m an optimist, though: I think morality and rationality would ultimately prevail, and settlement and rebuilding begin.</p><p>The world as we know it has ended. The crucial question is: now what?</p><p>Once the survivors have come to terms with their predicament&#x2014;the collapse of the entire infrastructure that previously supported their lives&#x2014;what can they do to rise from the ashes to ensure they thrive in the long term? What crucial knowledge would they need to recover as rapidly as possible?</p><p>This is a survivors&#x2019; guidebook. Not one just concerned with keeping people alive in the weeks after the Fall&#x2014;plenty of handbooks have been written on survival skills&#x2014;but one that teaches how to orchestrate the rebuilding of a technologically advanced civilization. If you suddenly found yourself without a working example, could you explain how to build an internal combustion engine, or a clock, or a microscope? Or, even more basic, how to successfully cultivate crops and make clothes? The apocalyptic scenarios I&#x2019;m presenting here are also the starting point for a thought experiment: they are a vehicle for examining the fundamentals of science and technology, which, as knowledge becomes ever more specialized, feel very remote to most of us.</p><p>People living in developed nations have become disconnected from the everyday processes of civilization that support them. Individually, we are astoundingly ignorant of even the basics of the production of food, shelter, clothes, medicine, materials, or vital substances. Our survival skills have atrophied to the point that much of humanity would be incapable of sustaining itself if the life-support system of modern civilization failed, if food no longer magically appeared on store shelves, or clothes on hangers. Of course, there was a time when everyone was a survivalist, with a far more intimate connection to the land and methods of production, and to survive in a post-apocalyptic world you&#x2019;d need to turn back the clock and relearn these core skills.*</p><p>What&#x2019;s more, each piece of modern technology we take for granted requires an enormous support network of other technologies. There&#x2019;s much more to making an iPhone than knowing the design and materials of each of its components. The device sits as the capstone on the very tip of a vast pyramid of enabling technologies: the mining and refining of the rare element indium for the touch screen, high-precision photolithographic manufacturing of microscopic circuitry in the computing processor chips, and the incredibly miniaturized components in the microphone, not to mention the network of cell phone towers and other infrastructure necessary to maintain telecommunications and the functioning of the phone. The first generation born after the Fall would find the internal mechanisms of a modern phone absolutely inscrutable, the pathways of its microchip circuits invisibly small to the human eye and their purpose utterly mysterious. The sci-fi author Arthur C. Clarke said in 1961 that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. In the aftermath of the Fall, the rub is that this miraculous technology would have belonged not to some star-faring alien species, but to people just a generation in our own past.</p><p>Even quotidian artifacts of our civilization that aren&#x2019;t particularly high-tech still require a diversity of raw materials that must be mined or otherwise gathered, processed in specialized plants, and assembled in a manufacturing facility. And all of this in turn relies on electrical power stations and transport over great distances. This point is made very eloquently in Leonard E. Read&#x2019;s 1958 essay written from the perspective of one of our most basic tools, &#x201c;I, Pencil.&#x201d; The astounding conclusion is that because the sourcing of raw materials and the methods of production are so dispersed, there is not a single person on the face of the Earth who knows how to make even this simplest of implements.</p><p>A potent demonstration of the gulf that now separates our individual capabilities and the production of even simple gizmos in our everyday life was offered by Thomas Thwaites when, in 2008, he attempted to make a toaster from scratch while studying for his MA at the Royal College of Art. He reverse-engineered a cheap toaster down to its barest essentials&#x2014;iron frame, mica-mineral insulating sheets, nickel heating filaments, copper wires and plug, and plastic casing&#x2014;and then sourced all the raw materials himself, digging them out of the ground in quarries and mines. He also looked up simpler, historical metallurgical techniques, referring to a sixteenth-century text to build a rudimentary iron-smelting furnace using a metal trash can, barbecue coals, and a leaf blower for bellows. The finished model is satisfyingly primitive but also grotesquely beautiful in its own right and neatly underscores the core of our problem.</p><p>Of course, even in one of the extreme doomsday scenarios, groups of survivors would not need to become self-sufficient immediately. If the great majority of the population succumbed to an aggressive virus, there would still be vast resources left behind. The supermarkets would remain stocked with plentiful food, and you could pick up a fine new set of designer clothes from the deserted department stores or liberate from the showroom the sports car you&#x2019;ve always dreamed about. Find an abandoned mansion, and with a little foraging it wouldn&#x2019;t be too hard to salvage some mobile diesel generators to keep the lighting, heating, and appliances running. Underground lakes of fuel remain beneath gas stations, sufficient to keep your new home and car functioning for a significant period. In fact, small groups of survivors could probably live pretty comfortably in the immediate aftermath of the Fall. For a while, civilization could coast on its own momentum. The survivors would find themselves surrounded by a wealth of resources there for the taking: a bountiful Garden of Eden.</p><p>But the Garden is rotting.</p><p>Food, clothes, medicines, machinery, and other technology inexorably decompose, decay, deteriorate, and degrade over time. The survivors are provided with nothing more than a grace period. With the collapse of civilization and the sudden arrest of key processes&#x2014;gathering raw materials, refining and manufacturing, transportation and distribution&#x2014;the hourglass is inverted and the sand steadily drains away. The remnants provide nothing more than a safety buffer to ease the transition to the moment when harvesting and manufacturing must begin anew.</p><p></p><p>A REBOOT MANUAL</p><p></p><p>The most profound problem facing survivors is that human knowledge is collective, distributed across the population. No one individual knows enough to keep the vital processes of society going. Even if a skilled technician from a steel foundry survived, he would only know the details of <i>his</i> job, not the subsets of knowledge possessed by other workers at the foundry that are vital for keeping it running&#x2014;let alone how to mine iron ore or provide electricity to keep the plant operating. The most visible technology we use daily is just the tip of a vast iceberg&#x2014;not only in the sense that it&#x2019;s based on a great manufacturing and organizational network that supports production, but also because it represents the heritage of a long history of advances and developments. The iceberg extends unseen through both space and time.</p><p>So where would survivors turn? A great deal of information will certainly remain in the books gathering dust on the shelves of the now-deserted libraries, bookshops, and homes. The problem with this knowledge, however, is that it isn&#x2019;t presented in a way appropriate for helping a fledgling society&#x2014;or an individual without specialist training. What do you think you&#x2019;d understand if you just pulled a medical textbook off the shelf and flipped through the pages of terminology and drug names? University medical textbooks presuppose a huge amount of prior knowledge, and are designed to work alongside teaching and practical demonstrations from established experts. Even if there were doctors among the first generation of survivors, they&#x2019;d be severely limited in what they could accomplish without test results or the cornucopia of modern drugs they were trained to use&#x2014;drugs that would be degrading on pharmacy shelves or in defunct hospital storage refrigerators.</p><p>Much of this academic literature would itself be lost, perhaps to fires ripping unchecked through empty cities. Even worse, much of the wealth of new knowledge generated each year, including that which I and other scientists produce and consume in our own research, is not recorded on any durable medium at all. The cutting edge of human understanding exists primarily as ephemeral bits of data: as specialist journals&#x2019; academic &#x201c;papers&#x201d; stored on website servers.</p><p>And the books aimed at general readers wouldn&#x2019;t be much more help. Can you imagine a group of survivors who had access to only the selection of books stocked in an average store? How far would a civilization get trying to rebuild itself from the wisdom contained in the pages of self-help guides to succeeding in business management, thinking yourself thin, or reading the body language of the opposite sex? The most absurd nightmare would be a post-apocalyptic society discovering a few yellowed and crumbly books and, thinking them the scientific wisdom of the ancients, trying to apply homeopathy to curb a plague or astrology to forecast harvests. Even the books in the science section would offer little help. The latest pop-sci page-turner may be engagingly written, make clever metaphorical use of everyday observations, and leave the reader with a deeper understanding of some new research, but it probably won&#x2019;t yield much pragmatic knowledge. In short, the vast majority of our collective wisdom would not be accessible&#x2014;at least in a usable form&#x2014;to the survivors of a cataclysm. So how best to help the survivors? What key information would a guidebook need to deliver, and how might it be structured?</p><p>I&#x2019;m not the first person to wrestle with this question. James Lovelock is a scientist with a formidable track record for striking at the heart of an issue long before his peers. He is most famous for his Gaia hypothesis, which posits that the entire planet&#x2014;a complex assemblage of rocky crust and oceans and swirling atmosphere, along with the thin smear of life that has established itself across the surface&#x2014;can be understood as a single entity that acts to damp down instabilities and self-regulate its environment over billions of years. Lovelock is deeply concerned that one element of this system, <i>Homo sapiens</i>, now has the capacity to disrupt these natural checks and balances with devastating effect.</p><p>Lovelock draws on a biological analogy to explain how we might safeguard our heritage: &#x201c;Organisms that face desiccation often encapsulate their genes in spores so that the information for their renewal is carried through the drought.&#x201d; The human equivalent envisaged by Lovelock is a book for all seasons, &#x201c;a primer on science, clearly written and unambiguous in its meaning&#x2014;a primer for anyone interested in the state of the Earth and how to survive and live well on it.&#x201d; What he proposes is a truly massive undertaking: recording the complete assemblage of human knowledge in a huge textbook&#x2014;a document that you could, at least in principle, read from cover to cover, and then walk away knowing the essentials of everything that is now known.</p><p>In fact, the idea of a &#x201c;total book&#x201d; has a much longer history. In the past, encyclopedia compilers appreciated far more acutely than we do today the fragility of even great civilizations, and the exquisite value of the scientific knowledge and practical skills held in the minds of the population that evaporate once the society collapses. Denis Diderot explicitly regarded his <i>Encyclop�die</i>, published between 1751 and 1772, as a safe repository of human knowledge, preserving it for posterity in case of a cataclysm that snuffs our civilization as the ancient cultures of the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans had all been lost, leaving behind only random surviving fragments of their writing. In this way, the encyclopedia becomes a time capsule of accumulated knowledge, all of it arranged logically and cross-referenced, protected against the erosion of time in case of a widespread catastrophe.</p><p>Since the Enlightenment our understanding of the world has increased exponentially, and the task of compiling a complete compendium of human knowledge would be orders of magnitude harder today. The creation of such a &#x201c;total book&#x201d; would represent a modern-era pyramid-building project, consuming the full-time exertion of tens of thousands of people over many years. The purpose of this toil would be to ensure not the safe passage of a pharaoh to eternal bliss in the afterworld, but the immortality of our civilization itself.</p><p>Such an all-consuming undertaking is not inconceivable if the will is ...</p></p><h2>Mystical Paths</h2><p>When Nicholas Darrow follows his father into the Anglican priesthood in 1968 at the age of twenty-five, he is fleeing a troubled past. But when his fascination with his own psychic powers results in a near-tragedy, Nicholas must face the truth about his relationship with his father before he can find his way out of the seemingly impenetrable darkness that engulfs him.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p><p><b>Susan Howatch</b> is a British novelist who has penned bestselling mysteries, family sagas, and other novels. Howatch was born in Surrey, England. She began writing as a teen and published her first book when she moved to the United States in 1964. Howatch found global success first with her five sagas and then with her novels about the Church of England in the twentieth century. She has now returned to live in Surrey.</p>The air is thick with incense and mysteries (both secular and non) in this fifth smashing novel in Howatch's High Church series (Spontaneous Risks, 1990, etc.). Whoever would have thought that she could turn 20th-century theology into bestsellerdom? But she's done it again, this time reminding us that she's a mistress of the generational novel as well--because, here, the sons of heroes (actually, psychically wounded antiheroes, scrambling back to God) from former volumes step up to, well, the altar. It doesn't take 25-year-old Nick Darrow long to get into deep spiritual trouble here; after all, he's not only psychically touched (like his 88-year-old father, Jon, from Glamorous Powers) but young, cocky, impatient, sexually hyperactive--and, to make matters worse, it's 1968. On the eve of Nick's ordination, a debutante friend convinces him to look into the death of Christian Aysgarth, a brilliant Oxford don who died suddenly in a boating accident, leaving behind a wife agonized with guilt because she thinks it was suicide. So, Nick to the rescue, with a botched exorcism and not-so-botched seduction of the grieving widow. Such occurrences, along with Nick's double life as a Casanova among working girls, make him dimly aware that his personality is frayed, but he can't open up to his saintly father for fear that the beloved old guy will die of horror. Nick plunges on, then, eventually getting so obsessed with the Aysgarth affair that he believes himself possessed by the dead man. That's when Father Lewis Hall shows up in his groovy white VW to take Nick by the hand and lead him to the light. Along the way back, Christian's death is resolved in a spiffy little climax that includes an attempted murder, an exorcism conducted--quite successfully this time--by Nick, and a spiritual healing between Nick and his father. If only spiritual guides showed up like fairy godmothers in real life! Howatch even brings psychological and theological meaning to Nick's salvation. A sure-fire hit. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Get ready for the ride of your life.<br><b><br>Velocity</b><br><br>Bill Wile is an easygoing, hardworking guy who leads a quiet, ordinary life. But that is about to change. One evening, after his usual eight-hour bartending shift, he finds a typewritten note under the windshield wiper of his car. <i>If you don&#x2019;t take this note to the police and get them involved, I will kill a lovely blond schoolteacher.

Besides, what could they do even if they took the note seriously? No crime has actually been committed. But less than twenty-four hours later, a young blond schoolteacher is found murdered, and it&#x2019;s Bill&#x2019;s fault: he didn&#x2019;t convince the police to get involved. Now he&#x2019;s got another note, another deadline, another ultimatum...and two new lives hanging in the balance.<br><br>Suddenly Bill&#x2019;s average, seemingly innocuous life takes on the dimensions and speed of an accelerating nightmare.

He had fallen off the roof of his two-story house, onto that cheerful-looking figure. The gnome was made of concrete. Henry wasn&#x2019;t.<br><br>A broken neck, a cracked skull: Henry perished on impact.<br><br>This death-by-gnome had occurred four years previously. Ned Pearsall still toasted Henry&#x2019;s passing at least once a week.<br><br>Now, from a stool near the curve of the polished mahogany bar, an out-of-towner, the only other customer, expressed curiosity at the enduring nature of Ned&#x2019;s animosity.<br><br>&#x201c;How bad a neighbor could the poor guy have been that you&#x2019;re still so juiced about him?&#x201d;<br><br>Ordinarily, Ned might have ignored the question. He had even less use for tourists than he did for pretzels.<br><br>The tavern offered free bowls of pretzels because they were cheap. Ned preferred to sustain his thirst with well-salted peanuts. To keep Ned tipping, Billy Wiles, tending bar, occasionally gave him a bag of Planters.<br><br>Most of the time Ned had to pay for his nuts. This rankled him either because he could not grasp the economic realities of tavern operation or because he enjoyed being rankled, probably the latter.<br><br>Although he had a head reminiscent of a squash ball and the heavy rounded shoulders of a sumo wrestler, Ned was an athletic man only if you thought barroom jabber and grudge-holding qualified as sports. In those events, he was an Olympian.<br><br>Regarding the late Henry Friddle, Ned could be as talkative with outsiders as with lifelong residents of Vineyard Hills. When, as now, the only other customer was a stranger, Ned found silence even less congenial than conversation with a &#x201c;foreign devil.&#x201d;<br><br>Billy himself had never been much of a talker, never one of those barkeeps who considered the bar a stage. He was a listener.<br><br>To the out-of-towner, Ned declared, &#x201c;Henry Friddle was a pig.&#x201d;<br><br>The stranger had hair as black as coal dust with traces of ash at the temples, gray eyes bright with dry amusement, and a softly resonant voice. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a strong word&#x2014;pig.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You know what the pervert was doing on his roof? He was trying to piss on my dining-room windows.&#x201d;<br><br>Wiping the bar, Billy Wiles didn&#x2019;t even glance at the tourist. He&#x2019;d heard this story so often that he knew all the reactions to it.<br><br>&#x201c;Friddle, the pig, figured the altitude would give his stream more distance,&#x201d; Ned explained.<br><br>The stranger said, &#x201c;What was he&#x2014;an aeronautical engineer?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He was a college professor. He taught contemporary literature.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe reading that stuff drove him to suicide,&#x201d; the tourist said, which made him more interesting than Billy had first thought.<br><br>&#x201c;No, no,&#x201d; Ned said impatiently. &#x201c;The fall was accidental.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Was he drunk?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why would you think he was drunk?&#x201d; Ned wondered.<br><br>The stranger shrugged. &#x201c;He climbed on a roof to urinate on your windows.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He was a sick man,&#x201d; Ned explained, plinking one finger against his empty glass to indicate the desire for another round.<br><br>Drawing Budweiser from the tap, Billy said, &#x201c;Henry Friddle was consumed by vengeance.&#x201d;<br><br>After silent communion with his brew, the tourist asked Ned Pearsall, &#x201c;Vengeance? So you urinated on Friddle&#x2019;s windows first?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t the same thing at all,&#x201d; Ned warned in a rough tone that advised the outsider to avoid being judgmental.<br><br>&#x201c;Ned didn&#x2019;t do it from his roof,&#x201d; Billy said.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. I walked up to his house, like a man, stood on his lawn, and aimed at his dining-room windows.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Henry and his wife were having dinner at the time,&#x201d; Billy said.<br><br>Before the tourist might express revulsion at the timing of this assault, Ned said, &#x201c;They were eating quail, for God&#x2019;s sake.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You showered their windows because they were eating quail?&#x201d;<br><br>Ned sputtered with exasperation. &#x201c;No, of course not. Do I look insane to you?&#x201d; He rolled his eyes at Billy.<br><br>Billy raised his eyebrows as though to say What do you expect of a tourist?<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just trying to convey how pretentious they were,&#x201d; Ned clarified, &#x201c;always eating quail or snails, or Swiss chard.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Phony bastards,&#x201d; the tourist said with such a light seasoning of mockery that Ned Pearsall didn&#x2019;t detect it, although Billy did.<br><br>&#x201c;Exactly,&#x201d; Ned confirmed. &#x201c;Henry Friddle drove a Jaguar, and his wife drove a car&#x2014;you won&#x2019;t believe this&#x2014;a car made in Sweden.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Detroit was too common for them,&#x201d; said the tourist.<br><br>&#x201c;Exactly. How much of a snob do you have to be to bring a car all the way from Sweden?&#x201d;<br><br>The tourist said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll wager they were wine connoisseurs.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Big time! Did you know them or something?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I just know the type. They had a lot of books.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got &#x2019;em nailed,&#x201d; Ned declared. &#x201c;They&#x2019;d sit on the front porch, sniffing their wine, reading books.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right out in public. Imagine that. But if you didn&#x2019;t pee on their dining-room windows because they were snobs, why did you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A thousand reasons,&#x201d; Ned assured him. &#x201c;The incident of the skunk. The incident of the lawn fertilizer. The dead petunias.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And the garden gnome,&#x201d; Billy added as he rinsed glasses in the bar sink.<br><br>&#x201c;The garden gnome was the last straw,&#x201d; Ned agreed.<br><br>&#x201c;I can understand being driven to aggressive urination by pink plastic flamingos,&#x201d; said the tourist, &#x201c;but, frankly, not by a gnome.&#x201d;<br><br>Ned scowled, remembering the affront. &#x201c;Ariadne gave it my face.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ariadne who?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Henry Friddle&#x2019;s wife. You ever heard a more pretentious name?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, the Friddle part brings it down to earth.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She was an art professor at the same college. She sculpted the gnome, created the mold, poured the concrete, painted it herself.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Having a sculpture modeled after you can be an honor.&#x201d;<br><br>The beer foam on Ned&#x2019;s upper lip gave him a rabid appearance as he protested: &#x201c;It was a gnome, pal. A drunken gnome. The nose was as red as an apple. It was carrying a beer bottle in each hand.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And its fly was unzipped,&#x201d; Billy added.<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks so much for reminding me,&#x201d; Ned grumbled. &#x201c;Worse, hanging out of its pants was the head and neck of a dead goose.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How creative,&#x201d; said the tourist.<br><br>&#x201c;At first I didn&#x2019;t know what the hell that meant&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Symbolism. Metaphor.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, yeah. I figured it out. Everybody who walked past their place saw it, and got a laugh at my expense.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t need to see the gnome for that,&#x201d; said the tourist.<br><br>Misunderstanding, Ned agreed: &#x201c;Right. Just hearing about it, people were laughing. So I busted up the gnome with a sledgehammer.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And they sued you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Worse. They set out another gnome. Figuring I&#x2019;d bust up the first, Ariadne had cast and painted a second.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I thought life was mellow here in the wine country.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then they tell me,&#x201d; Ned continued, &#x201c;if I bust up the second one, they&#x2019;ll put a third on the lawn, plus they&#x2019;ll manufacture a bunch and sell &#x2019;em at cost to anyone who wants a Ned Pearsall gnome.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sounds like an empty threat,&#x201d; said the tourist. &#x201c;Would there really be people who&#x2019;d want such a thing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dozens,&#x201d; Billy assured him.<br><br>&#x201c;This town&#x2019;s become a mean place since the p�t�-and-brie crowd started moving in from San Francisco,&#x201d; Ned said sullenly.<br><br>&#x201c;So when you didn&#x2019;t dare take a sledgehammer to the second gnome, you were left with no choice but to pee on their windows.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Exactly. But I didn&#x2019;t just go off half-cocked. I thought about the situation for a week. Then I hosed them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;After which, Henry Friddle climbed on his roof with a full bladder, looking for justice.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah. But he waited till I had a birthday dinner for my mom.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Unforgivable,&#x201d; Billy judged.<br><br>&#x201c;Does the Mafia attack innocent members of a man&#x2019;s family?&#x201d; Ned asked indignantly.<br><br>Although the question had been rhetorical, Billy played for his tip: &#x201c;No. The Mafia&#x2019;s got class.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Which is a word these professor types can&#x2019;t even spell,&#x201d; Ned said. &#x201c;Mom was seventy-six. She could have had a heart attack.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; the tourist said, &#x201c;while trying to urinate on your dining-room windows, Friddle fell off his roof and broke his neck on the Ned Pearsall gnome. Pretty ironic.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know ironic,&#x201d; Ned replied. &#x201c;But it sure was sweet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tell him what your mom said,&#x201d; Billy urged.<br><br>Following a sip of beer, Ned obliged: &#x201c;My mom told me, &#x2018;Honey, praise the Lord, this proves there&#x2019;s a God.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>After taking a moment to absorb those words, the tourist said, &#x201c;She sounds like quite a religious woman.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She wasn&#x2019;t always. But at seventy-two, she caught pneumonia.&#x201d;<br>...</p><h2>Web of Evil: A Novel of Suspense (Ali Reynolds)</h2><p>Hopping mad after her termination from a high-profile anchor job, Ali Reynolds returns to her Arizona hometown and vents her outrage on a personal blog, but when her estranged husband is found dead in Palm Springs, Ali finds herself accused of his murder.

So he tried again, but nothing changed. It was dark -- a hot black stifling darkness that seemed to suck the breath out of him. He sensed movement, heard the whine of tires on pavement, but he had no idea where he was or how he'd gotten there. He tried to move his legs but couldn't. They were jammed up under his belly in a space that was far too small, and they seemed to be tied together somehow. </p><p> His hands were stuck behind him, shoved up against something hard. After several minutes of struggling he was finally able to shift his body enough to free them. He was stunned to discover that they, too, had been bound together in the same manner his legs were. The combination of their being tied too tight and being stuck under his body had cut off the circulation. At first his hands were nothing more than a pair of useless and inextricably connected dead-weight cudgels. After a few moments the blood returned to his fingers in a rush of needle-and-pin agony. </p><p> As his senses gradually reasserted themselves, he realized that the rough surface under his cheek was carpet of some kind, and from somewhere nearby came the distinctive smell of new rubber -- a spare tire. That meant he was in the trunk of someone's vehicle being taken God knows where. He tried to shout, but of course he couldn't do that, either. His mouth was taped shut. All that emerged from his throat was a guttural groan. </p><p> What was it you were you supposed to do if you found yourself trapped in a vehicle like that? Kick out the taillights, hang an arm out the hole, and signal for help? But he couldn't kick anything. He couldn't move his legs, and his bound hands were still useless. </p><p> As the man gradually understood the seriousness of his predicament, his heart beat faster while his breath quickened to short panicky gasps. For a while he was afraid he was going to pass out again, but he fought it -- fought to bring his breathing back under control. Fought to concentrate. What the hell was happening? Where was he? Who was doing this? And why? </p><p> He tried to remember something about what had gone on before. He had a dim recollection of something like a party. Lots of lights and laughter, lots of girls, lots of liquor. So had he gotten drunk and pissed someone off? Was that what was going on? He knew that given enough scotch he wasn't anyone's idea of Mr. Congeniality, but still... </p><p> Sweat trickled down the side of his face and dribbled into one eye, burning like fire. Without the use of his hands, there was no way to brush it away. </p><p> The vehicle slowed suddenly and swerved to the right, rolling him back onto his hands. Outside he heard the roar of a semi going past followed immediately by another and another. So they were on a busy freeway somewhere -- or had just left one. But where? As hot as it was, it had to be somewhere over the mountains -- somewhere in the desert. Palm Springs, maybe? Or maybe farther north, up toward Needles and Parker. </p><p> <i>Why can't I remember where I was or what happened?</i> he wondered. He had always prided himself on being able to hold his liquor. He wasn't like some of the guys he knew, high-powered wheeler-dealers who would have to call around after a wild night on the town, checking with valets at local watering holes to see where they had left their favorite Porsche or Ferrari. He usually knew exactly where he'd been. He also knew when he'd had enough. But now, his mind was fuzzy. He couldn't quite pull things together -- not just tonight, but what had gone on in the days before that, either. </p><p> The vehicle slowed again. He braced himself, expecting another right-hand turn. Instead, the vehicle turned sharply to the left and bounced off the pavement and onto a much rougher surface. Fine dust swirled inside the small space, filling his eyes and nostrils, making his eyes water and his nose run. Definitely the desert somewhere. </p><p> There was another hard jolting bump, then the vehicle came to a sudden halt. What must have been the driver's door opened and shut. And then there was nothing. No sound at all. At first he hoped and dreaded that the trunk lid would click open and his captor would free him, but that didn't happen. He strained his ears, hoping to establish if the freeway was still near enough that he'd be able to hear semis speeding past, but for the longest time, he heard nothing at all. He felt only the oppressive heat and wondered how long it would be before the oxygen ran out and he suffocated. </p><p> He felt it first. The car trembled as if it were alive, as if it were being racked by a bad case of the chills. Then he heard it -- a distant rumble growing louder and louder until it turned into an unmistakable roar. The car rocked in concert with the sound until the terrible roar and the shaking were one. It was then the man heard the shrill, earth-shattering screech of a fast-approaching freight train. The whistle sounded once, in a single, long, warning wail. Only then did he realize that whoever had locked him in the trunk had left him on the train tracks -- left him there to die. </p><p> He struggled desperately against his restraints, but it was no use. He couldn't free himself. The engine of the speeding eastbound train plowed into the stationary vehicle, peeling it open like an empty tin can and then dragging the wreckage along underneath the engine for the additional mile it took for the shaken engineer to finally bring the fully loaded train to a stop. As the engineer spoke to the 911 operator in Palm Springs, he reported having seen something fly up and out of the shattered vehicle, something that had looked more like a rag doll than it did a human being. </p><p> </p><p> Copyright � 2007 by J.A.

For those of you who may be new to the site, the last few months have been a bit of a bumpy ride since both my husband and my former employer simultaneously sent me packing in hopes of landing a younger model. </p><p> My soon-to-be-ex, aka Fang, as he's known in the blogosphere, called me yesterday. It was the first time I'd heard from him directly in several months. What surprised me more than anything was how much I DIDN'T feel when I heard his voice. That, I believe, is a good sign. It turns out Fang was calling, in his own imperious way, to make sure I'd be in court tomorrow so the divorce decree can be finalized. I could have given him grief about it. Could have claimed I was sick or maimed or just too annoyed to bother driving eight hours plus from Sedona over to L.A. And, had I done so, it would have sent him up a wall. You see, Fang needs this divorce right about now a whole lot more than I do. Our court appearance is scheduled Friday. Saturday is Fang's wedding day. </p><p> I've heard rumors that he and his blushing bride, aka Twink, are planning a big-deal celebration, a catered affair with all the right people in attendance at what used to be our joint domicile on Robert Lane. In view of the fact that Twink is expecting Fang's baby within weeks of the scheduled nuptials, you might think a little more discretion was called for, but discretion has never been Fang's long suit. For that matter, it must not be Twink's, either, since the baby was conceived some time prior to my abandoning our marriage bed. </p><p> For those of you who are concerned about my state of mind as I approach this change in marital status, don't be. I'm fine. I'm ready to make a clean break of it; glad to have what was clearly my sham of a marriage -- as far as Fang was concerned anyway -- over and done with. I'm moving on with my new life. When you're doing that, hanging on to the old one doesn't help. Neither does bitterness. As my mother is prone to point out, bitterness destroys the container it's in. </p><p> If I do say so myself, this particular container is going to be in pretty fine shape tomorrow when I show up in court. With my son's help, I've been working out. My personal shopper at Nordstrom's down in Scottsdale has set aside a couple of new outfits for me. I plan on picking up one of them on my way through Phoenix later on this afternoon. </p><p> In other words, for today anyway, I'm a rolling stone, and rolling stones gather no moss -- and do no blogging. </p><p> <i>Posted 7:23 a.m., September 15, 2005 by Babe</i> </p><p> </p><p> As soon as Ali Reynolds hauled her suitcase out of the closet, Samantha, Ali's now permanent refugee cat, disappeared. Completely. Ali found it hard to believe that a sixteen-pound, one-eared cat could pull off that kind of magicianship, but she could. </p><p> Six months earlier, a series of forced moves had left Sam in a new, unfamiliar home with a new owner who wasn't exactly enamored of cats. Over time, Ali and Sam had developed a grudging respect for each other. With the unwelcome appearance of a suitcase, however, all bets were off. For Sam, the sight of a suitcase and/or the dreaded cat crate brought back all those bad old times and sent the panicky kitty scrambling for someplace to hide. </p><p> It took Ali a good two hours -- two hours she didn't have -- to find the animal again, scrunched in beside the drainpipe behind the washing machine in the laundry room. And finding Sam was only part of the problem. Extricating the cat from her snug little hidey-hole and into the cat crate for a trip to Ali's parents' place was a whole other issue. Had it been any other weekend, Sam could have remained at home and been looked after by Ali's son, Christopher, but it happened that Chris was due at a two-day seminar in Phoenix starting early Saturday morning. </p><p> "Off to Grandma's with you," Ali said, retrieving the indignant cat and stuffing her into the waiting crate. "And you'd better behave yourself, too." </p><p> And so, hours later than she had intended, Ali finally finished packing. With Sam yowling in bitter protest, Ali left her hilltop mobile-h...</p></p><h2>The Value of Respect: The Story of Abraham Lincoln (Valuetales)</h2><p>A brief biography of Abraham Lincoln emphasizing the importance of respect of his life.</p><p></p><h2>Sonic the Hedgehog Archives, Vol. 1</h2><p>Picking up where the Sonic the Hedgehog: The Beginning trade paperback left off, Sonic the Hedgehog Archives #1 dives right into the action, starting with the first issue of Sonic&#39;s ongoing comic book series all the way up through issue #4.

Built using a technology unequaled even today, the ancient Egyptians claimed they inherited their advanced culture from a race of giants who lived during a previous age known as Sep Tepi, the First Time. <br> <br>In his earlier companion book <em>From the Ashes of Angels</em>, Andrew Collins provided sound historical evidence to show that this strange race, described in ancient mythology as Elder gods and fallen angels, founded pre-Pharonic Egypt. Now, in <em>Gods of Eden</em>, he describes their remarkable achievements. <br> <br>Assembling clues from archaeology, mythology, and religion, Collins shows us how this prehistoric global society mastered acoustic technology and employed the use of sound to raise heavy objects into the air and pierce holes through solid rock. It was with this technology that they were able to construct pyramids and other gigantic structures everywhere from Egypt to Peru, Mexico to ancient Tibet. Collins explains the traces left by these Elder gods from ancient texts worldwide and demonstrates their role in the foundations of ancient astronomy over 10,000 years ago. With findings based on more than twenty years of research and scholarship, Collins reveals the fascinating historical destiny of this fallen race and defines the imprints and legacies they left behind at the genesis of civilization. <br> <br>ANDREW COLLINS has been investigating the idea of an advanced civilization existing before recorded history since 1979.

This collection contains two stories not previously published, and it contains an introduction by Hal Clement, with cover art by Hannibal King.</p><p>An entry in the NESFA&#39;s Choice Series of neglected sf authors.A major retrospective of 24 stories, 193464, including two previously unpublished, from Leinster (18961976; real name Will Jenkins), a storysmith with a talented and educated imagination, though he proved a poor novelist, ultimately unable to transcend the pulps. While innovative and creative, he retained a firm grip on real science indeed, some of his ideas now appear astonishingly prescient. He wrote the first computer-paranoia yarn, ``A Logic Named Joe,'' back in an era when computers weren't even a gleam in Bill Gates's eye. In ``First Contact,'' he proposed a solution to the problem of spacefaring humans confronting aliens of similar psychology and technological development. ``Exploration Team'' contemptuously bats away the notion that machines, even intelligent robots, could successfully explore dangerous new worlds; Leinster instead provides his own unique insight. ``Sidewise in Time'' wonders what might happen if you move, not up or down the stream of time, but across it. ``The Lonely Planet'' invents the idea of a planetary consciousness. Elsewhere, a character receives a phone call from himself, one week in the future; a man-who-fell-to-earth isn't just immortal, he's insane as well, while other aliens don't just imitate, they become humans, or attempt to teach students of alchemy the principles of electricity. There are plenty of flimsy entries, too, of course, but the best of them are remarkable inventions, providing a window on to science fiction's first Golden Age that demonstrates exactly what made it golden. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The 1930s includes coverage of the Great Depression, the "golden age" of radio, the Lindbergh baby kidnapping, and the trial of the Scottsboro Boys. The 1900s deals with such topics as immigration, the Wright brothers, Henry Ford, and American imperialism. The 1920s discusses the stock market crash, the Ku Klux Klan, the Scopes trial, prohibition, and more. Although the selections are taken from the works of qualified historians and journalists from the 1950s on, their readability varies. While parenthetical editorial explanations clarify some references, other terms remain obscure and may confuse readers. Each volume has a comprehensive introduction, an annotated table of contents, a thorough index, and a detailed chronology of events and inventions. Unlike the "A Cultural History of the United States through the Decades" series (Lucent, 1998), photographs are sparse in the Greenhaven offerings. These books are most likely to be used by students researching specific time periods or the origins of current American politics, culture, and economy. With its newspaper-style format of one-to-two page articles and copious large photographs, the "Our Century" series (Gareth Stevens, 1993) is more appealing to casual readers.<br><i>Ann G.

In this seminal work, Stephen R. Covey presents a holistic, integrated, principle-centred approach for solving personal and professional problems. With penetrating insights and pointed anecdotes, Covey reveals a step-by-step pathway for living with fairness, integrity, honesty and human dignity - principles that give us the security to adapt to change, and the wisdom and power to take advantage of the opportunities that change creates. The 7 Habits have become so famous because they work. From Habit 1: Be Proactive and Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind, millions of people have worked their way through the 7 and found in them a key to transforming their lives. Translated into thirty-four languages THE 7 HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE has been the key to the success of legions of business leaders and individuals the world over.</p><p>Anyone who thinks the audiocassette adaptation of Stephen Covey's bestseller, <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i>, is a shortcut to reading the book has another thing coming. As a preview, the cassette is worth every one of its 90 minutes; as a substitute for the original, it will only leave you wishing for the rest. There's a reason <i>7 Habits</i> has sold more than 5 million copies and been translated into 32 languages. Serious work has obviously gone into it, and serious change can likely come out of it--but only with constant discipline and steadfast commitment. As the densely packed tape makes immediately clear, this is no quick fix for what's ailing us in our personal and professional lives.<p> The tape opens to the silky-smooth, overtrained voice of the female narrator, who's responsible for tying together audio clips from actual Covey seminars. Leaving aside the occasional attempts at promoting Covey and his institute, her script does a first-rate job of making sense of Covey's own intense, analogy-rich style of explaining his habits. There's nothing simple about his approach to becoming an effective person. The first three habits alone--which have to do with personal responsibility, leadership, and self-management--could take years to master. Yet the last four are unattainable, the narrator insists, if you can't acquire the personal security--the "inner core," says Covey--that presumably comes from a mastery of the foundation.</p><p> Throughout our lessons, Covey's presence is both learned and thoroughly appealing. He drops references to the likes of Socrates, T.S. Eliot, and Robert Frost with the aplomb of an English professor. And his knack for mixing everyday stories with abstract concepts manages to clarify difficult issues while respecting our intelligence. You could argue that the cassette is nothing more than a clever marketing tool for selling another few million copies of the book. But, even at that, it's worth the investment in time and concentration: in the end, we're moved to learn more about integrating all seven habits in our struggle to become better and, yes, more effective people. (Running time: 1.5 hours, one cassette) <i>--Ann Senechal</i></p><i>The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People</i> is a comprehensive program based on developing an awareness of how perceptions and assumptions hinder success---in business as well as presonal relationships. Here's an approach that will help broaden your way of thinking and lead to greater opportunities and effective problem solving. Be Pro-Active: Take the initiative and the responsibility to make things happen. Begin With an End in Mind: Start with a clear destination to understand where you are now, where you're going and what you value most. Put First Things First: Manage yourself. Organize and execute around priorities. Think Win/Win: See life as a cooperative, not a comprehensive arena where success is not achieved at the expense or exclusion of the success of others. Seek First to Understand: Understand then be understood to build the skills of empathetic listening that inspires openness and trust. Synergize: Apply the principles of cooperative creativity and value differences. Renewal: Preserving and enhanving your greatest asset, yourself, by renewing the physical, spiritual, mental and social/emotional dimensions of your nature. Stephen R. Covey is the most respected motivator in the business world today.

An essential reference for every serious reader of the Bible.<br><br>B &amp; W illustrations and line-art throughout.In the past 30 years , there have been three major encyclopedic Bible dictionaries published in English: The Interpreter's Bible Dictionary (IBD ), the Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible , and The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia ( ISBE ). When it was published in 1962 (with a supplementary volume in 1976), the IBD represented the state of critical Biblical scholarship. The ISBE , though an extensive revision of the previous edition (1929), retained many articles from its predecessors (1915 and 1929). Because of the numerous developments in biblical scholarship during the past three decades, the editor felt (rightly) that it was time for a Bible dictionary that would represent the current state of the discipline. The Anchor Bible Dictionary ( ABD ) is the result of his vision. The ABD is both international and interconfessional, with nearly 1000 contributors from around the world representing Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, and Muslim traditions (and also those of no religious tradition). The list of contributing scholars includes names long associated with biblical and theological studies. The currency of the dictionary as a whole is reflected especially in the inclusion of such subjects as the Dead Sea Scrolls, early Jewish-Christian relations, the historical Jesus, and sociological and literary methods of biblical criticism (including feminist hermeneutics), and in numerous entries on archaeological sites. In addition, the bibliographies are usually up to date and often extensive. Unlike previous Bible dictionaries, the bibliographic entries in the ABD are complete citations, listed individually rather than in a run-on fashion, and hence easier to use. Even in such a monumental success as the ABD , there are weak spots. One might expect to find pronunciations, especially for place and personal names--which is the case with the IBD and the ISBE --but none are given here. There are few illustrations throughout. The maps are inadequate, and some of the topics are handled clumsily. Yet overall, this is a solid piece of work, well written and well edited. It will serve scholars and students because of its currency and thoroughness and lay readers because of its generally readable style. The ABD deserves a place on the shelves beside the standard Bible dictionaries of previous generations and is recommended for public, academic, and seminary libraries.<br><i>- Craig W.

The transplanted modern West Virginians and their allies in the United States of Europe now take to the sea, with Admiral Simpson bringing essentially Civil War naval technology to the seventeenth century. The impact is considerable. Meanwhile, the Spanish siege of Amsterdam simmers, with Gretchen Richter and the Committee of Correspondence holding high the banner of radical politics, which is quite plausible, given the era's many uprisings. The French besieging Luebeck are more determined, but the USE has such assets as Sweden's King Gustavus Adolphus and an early machine gun. And the sympathetic characters, who are in the majority even if on the wrong side, face ethical dilemmas far more complex than either the political machinations or the at-this-time advanced technology. The charming Swedish princess Kristina wants to learn to fly, but will that mean giving up autocratic habits and marrying a Danish prince? Eddie Cantrell wrestles with helping the king of Denmark build new weapons for use against the USE and with whether he can safely bed that same king's nubile daughter. And a German machine-gunner of peasant stock wonders whether he can love and be loved by someone obviously from the future&#x2014;a social worker. A splendid example of character-centered alternate-history, this is a must read for its series' growing fandom.

His essays in the history of technology are more like random walks, paeans to serendipity. In <i>The Knowledge Web</i> Burke attempted to duplicate on paper the feeling of inter- and cross-linking trends that you find in history and on the World Wide Web. The essays in <i>Circles</i> are more artificially restricted, topological circles that wrap around. A typical trip goes from the Space Shuttle to <i>Skylab</i> to Werner von Braun to feedback to digestion to lab animals to the Humane Society to sea rescues to charting sea currents to Foucault to astronomical photography to the solar corona to <i>Skylab</i>. Whew!<p> "There are two reasons why I make such play of the unstructured nature of history, but then, in this book, give it a formal shape," Burke says. "One reason is that otherwise these essays would have mirrored the serendipity I described, just going from anywhere to anywhere.... Choosing to go round in circles, and to end each story where it begins, lets me illustrate perhaps the most intriguing aspect of serendipity at work, which shows itself in the way in which history generates the most extraordinary coincidences."

It&#39;s an easy to follow, 100% natural program that combines an elemental liquid bowel rest diet with tried and tested natural remedies proven to heal the rectum, bowel and colon. If you&#39;re ready to take control of your health and heal your IBD naturally, then make the most of this step-by-step program to: 1. Stop bleeding and heal inflammation 2. Give intestinal fissures, fistulas and ulcers time to heal 3. Heal the mucosal lining of the intestine with targeted amino acids and herbs 4. Heal leaky gut syndrome 5. Clear intestinal obstructions 6. Replace bad and imbalanced intestinal flora with good bacteria 7. Provide a layer of good bacteria to coat and protect the mucosal lining from toxins, parasites, fungus and damage 8. Ensure long-term, ongoing health in the entire GI system 9. Heal and balance the immune system with proven supplements 10. Gain solid weight (muscle) if underweight or malnourished 11. Test for food intolerances and allergies 12. Achieve emotional healing 13. Prevent relapses with a Maintenance Diet Dozens of clinical studies have shown that an elemental liquid diet is as effective as steroids at inducing remission for IBD, in an average 3 to 6 weeks. An elemental diet is one where EVERYTHING you consume for 3 to 6 weeks is in liquid, pre-digested form. It combines protein shakes with vegetable broths, bone broths, homemade jello and supplements. You can also do a vegan version. But if you &#34;cheat&#34;, you will not be providing the total bowel rest necessary for healing. Because your diet is completely liquid, be prepared for multiple liquid bowel movements throughout the day. This is not diarrhea - liquid elemental diets produce liquid stool. You will likely need to take time off your regular schedule to do this diet.</p><p></p><h2>Ferrari 312T 1975 to 1980 (312T, T2, T3, T4, T5 &amp; T6): An insight into the design, engineering, maintenance and operation of Ferrari's series of ...

In January of 1999, the arrest of Wen Ho Lee, the Los Alamos scientist who was falsely accused of espionage by the U.S. government and imprisoned without trial, sparked controversy throughout the country. Throughout the ordeal, Wen Ho Lee quietly and steadfastly maintained his innocence. Now he tells his story. A riveting account about prejudice, fear, suspicionand courage, <em>My Country Versus Me</em> offers at last a clear and truthful look at one of the great miscarriages of justice of our time.</p><p><strong>Wen Ho Lee</strong> lives with his wife in Los Alamos, New Mexico.<br><br> <strong>Helen Zia</strong>, an award-winning journalist and author of <em>Asian American Dreams</em>, has covered Asian American communities and social and political movements for more than twenty years.

Using an accent mimicking the author's native Taiwanese, Fred Stella clearly expresses Lee's anger. The book's language reflects the mixture of sophistication and slang one finds in educated nonnative speakers of English, making a convincing performance of Lee's exculpatory account of his ordeal at the hands of a system he claims suspected him because of his Asian background. Stella utilizes nonaccented speech for the other principals to illuminate this scientist's protest.

A native of New Jersey, Michael Shaara grew to be an adventurous young man: over the years, he found work as a sailor, a paratrooper, a policeman, and an English professor at Florida State University. In 1952, his son Jeff was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey. <br><br>Michael's interest in Gettysburg was prompted by some letters written by his great-grandfather, who had been wounded at the great battle while serving with the 4th Georgia Infantry. In 1966, he took his family on a vacation to the battlefield and found himself moved.<br><br>In 1970, Michael Shaara returned to Gettysburg with his son Jeff. The pair crisscrossed the historic site, gathering detailed information for the father's novel-in-progress. In 1974, the novel was published with the title <i>The Killer Angels</i>. This gripping fictional account of the three bloody days at Gettysburg won Michael Shaara a Pulitzer Prize and a vast, appreciative audience. To date it has sold two million copies.<br><br>When Michael Shaara died in 1988, his son Jeff began to manage his literary estate. It was a legacy he knew well, having helped his father create it. When director Ron Maxwell filmed the movie <i>Gettysburg</i>, based on <i>The Killer Angels</i>, he asked Jeff to serve as a consultant. Maxwell encouraged Shaara to continue the story his father began; inspired, Jeff planned an ambitious trilogy, with <i>The Killer Angels</i> as the centerpiece, following the war from its origins to its end.<br><br>With <b>Gods and Generals</b>, Jeff Shaara gives fans of <i>The Killer Angels</i> everything they could have asked--an epic, brilliantly written saga that brings the nation's greatest conflict to life.</p><p>In a prequel of sorts to his father Michael Shaara's 1974 epic novel <i>The Killer Angels</i>, Jeff Shaara explores the lives of Generals Lee, Hancock, Jackson and Chamberlain as the pivotal Battle of Gettysburg approaches. Shaara captures the disillusionment of both Lee and Hancock early in their careers, Lee's conflict with loyalty, Jackson's overwhelming Christian ethic and Chamberlain's total lack of experience, while illustrating how each compensated for shortcomings and failures when put to the test. The perspectives of the four men, particularly concerning the battles at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, make vivid the realities of war.I arrived at Ballantine shortly before then-publisher Clare Ferraro dropped a 1,200 page doorstop on my desk, practically causing it to bow in the middle. This was the original version of GODS AND GENERALS by Jeff Shaara. I quickly read THE KILLER ANGELS to get a feel for the subject, and then started plowing through G&amp;G. After about 400 pages, Jeff began to find a comfortable style and method of telling the story of Lee, Hancock, Armistead, Chamberlain, Longstreet, and Stonewall Jackson before the battle of Gettysburg. And the book kept getting better. After beating out Turner Books (which has since gone out of business) for the right to publish GODS AND GENERALS, I met Jeff, and we began to get to work. He and I hit it off right from the beginning. Strangely enough, he was born exactly ten years to the day before my best friend, so perhaps it was in the stars that we would work well together.<br><br>The biggest challenge of editing GODS AND GENERALS was cutting it down. It was actually easier than one might think, because Jeff had made a typical first-time novelist's mistake--he started his story too early. When Jeff came into my office, he started out by saying "Now one thing we can't do is cut this manuscript . . . " After getting over the initial shock of my suggestion of cutting the first 400 pages of the book, within fifteen minutes he was completely turned around, saying, "We can't publish this book unless we cut the first 400 pages!"<br><br>Jeff had started writing about his characters in the Mexican War, and in the peacetime army of the 1850s. While the Mexican War chapters were exciting, they didn't belong in GODS AND GENERALS. And nothing happened in the 1850s, militarily speaking. So Jeff compressed a lot of information into a small number of pages, and begain GODS AND GENERALS in 1858, with Lee's return home to execute the estate of his late father-in-law, and then with John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry.<br><br>As an interesting footnote, Jeff's next book will be about the Mexican War. But I've already told him he can't recycle scenes from the 400 pages we cut. He's a much better writer now!<br><br>Doug Grad, Editor</p><h2>Naming Thy Name: Cross Talk in Shakespeare&#39;s Sonnets</h2><p><p><b>A fascinating case for the identity of Shakespeare&#x2019;s beautiful young man</b></p><p>SHAKESPEARE&#x2019;S SONNETS ARE indisputably the most enigmatic and enduring love poems written in English. They also may be the most often argued-over sequence of love poems in any language. But what is it that continues to elude us? While it is in part the spellbinding incantations, the hide-and-seek of sound and meaning, it is also the mystery of the noble youth to whom Shakespeare makes a promise&#x2015;the promise that the youth will survive in the breath and speech and minds of all those who read these sonnets. &#x201c;How can such promises be fulfilled if no name is actually given?&#x201d; Elaine Scarry asks. </p><p>This book is the answer. Naming Thy Name lays bare William Shakespeare&#x2019;s devotion to a beloved whom he not only names but names repeatedly in the microtexture of the sonnets, in their architecture, and in their deep fabric, immortalizing a love affair. By naming his name, Scarry enables us to hear clearly, for the very first time, a lover&#x2019;s call and the beloved&#x2019;s response. Here, over the course of many poems, are two poets in conversation, in love, speaking and listening, writing and writing back. </p><p>In a true work of alchemy, Scarry, one of America&#x2019;s most innovative and passionate thinkers, brilliantly synthesizes textual analysis, literary criticism, and historiography in pursuit of the haunting call and recall of Shakespeare&#x2019;s verse and that of his (now at last named) beloved friend.</p></p><p><b>Elaine Scarry</b> is the Cabot Professor of Aesthetics and the General Theory of Value at Harvard University. Her book <i>The Body in Pain</i> was a National Book Critics Circle Award finalist. She lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<p>"Scarry . . . poses a surprising answer to a question that has puzzled readers of Shakespeare&#x2019;s sonnets for 400 years [about] the &#x201c;lovely boy" of the poems. . . .She also makes a fresh suggestion identifying the &#x201c;rival poet&#x201d; of Shakespeare&#x2019;s sonnets . . . Scarry&#x2019;s conclusions . . . invite a close reading of the sonnets and a pure enjoyment of the metaphorical power and linguistic intricacy of each line." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Naming thy Name</i> is a beautiful book. It is a love story: of the love between William Shakespeare and Henry Constable, and of another writer&#x2019;s true love for that love. There has been no book that has so thoroughly explored the practice of poetic conversation among the sonneteers of the English Renaissance. And there has been no book, at least since Oscar Wilde&#x2019;s <i>Portrait of Mr. W. H.</i>, that has been so passionate in pursuit of a theory, a theory of the love behind all Shakespeare&#x2019;s other loves. Scarry has given us the latest, bravest answer to a question no reader of the sonnets can fail to ask.&#x201d;&#x2015;Jeff Dolven</p><p>&#x201c;I picked up <i>Naming thy Name </i>and, as they say in Dublin, I couldn&#x2019;t leave it down. I expected brilliance, having read Elaine Scarry's previous works, but am persuaded that this time she has managed somehow to outdo even her own previous outdoing. This is a major, impressively eloquent work of scholarship&#x2015;who would have thought there was anything new and important to say about the exhaustively annotated Bard?&#x2015;that will be read and discussed for years, no, for decades to come.&#x201d; &#x2015;Joel Conarroe</p><p>&#x201c;. . . devoted Shakespeareans will be ravished by her brilliant speculations.&#x201d; &#x2015;Ray Olson, <i>Booklist</i></p><p>&#x201c;. . . a tantalizing exercise in literary puzzle-making.&#x201d;&#x2015;<i>The New Yorker</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;</i>The book is a joy to read even if you are not completely convinced of the accuracy of Scarry&#x2019;s thesis. The stories are entertaining and you can certainly appreciate the scholarship and the opportunity to see the work of William Shakespeare in a new light&#x2015;the work of a man more human than demigod.&#x201d;&#x2015;Michael L. Ramsey<i>, Roanoke Times</i></p><p>"Elaine Scarry accomplishes [a] seemingly impossible feat with a fresh, enthralling argument: The bulk of Shakespeare&#x2019;s sonnets are a paean to his muse, poet Henry Constable, who in turn acknowledged mutual feelings in his own work. <i>Naming Thy Name</i>, then, is a model of literary criticism, scholarly yet rendered with flair, a beautiful portrayal of secretive, enduring love.&#x201d; &#x2015;Hamilton Cain, <i>Minneapolis Star Tribune</i></p></p><h2>Zane Grey: Outdoorsman</h2><p>A follow-up to one of the most successful books on choppers ever published presents 21 new artist profiles and more than 300 new bikes.</p><p>Photographer Tom Zimberoff began his career in rock 'n roll photography, touring with groups such as the Jackson Five, Stevie Wonder, and the Rolling Stones.

If these acronyms ring a bell, their ubiquitous logos springing instantly to mind, then you know the work of Paul Rand (1914-1996), the Picasso of Graphic Design. A pioneer in the field of visual communication, Rand developed a fresh and individual design language drawn from European art movements including Russian constructivism, de Stijl, and the Bauhaus. His career as an art director, teacher, writer, and design consultant to major corporations spanned almost seven decades. Rand arguably got his start at the tender of 3 when he first began to secretly copy pictures of the attractive Palmolive models pictured in advertising displays in his father's grocery store in Brooklyn, New York. He later modeled his aesthetic on avant-garde artists like Paul Klee, El Lissitzky, and architect Le Corbusier, each of whom advocated a timeless spirit in design. Rand began his career in an era when working by hand was a given, a reality that would change before his eyes as the mass media, entertainment, and consumer industries were revolutionized by increasingly technical equipment, and ultimately the computer. <p> Steven Heller, senior art director at <i>The New York Times</i> and prominent author of numerous design books, presents this meticulously researched and detailed survey, which marks the first complete retrospective of Rand's powerful body of work, exploring the full range of his advertising, publishing, and corporate identity projects. Eminent designer Armin Hofmann writes the forward, and the introduction is penned by advertising legend George Lois, who writes, "The constant concern of the scholarly and humanistic Paul Rand was to create images that snared people's eyes, penetrated their minds, warmed their hearts and made them act." Appropriately, the designers of this large, bold, beautifully designed book seem well versed in Randism themselves, creating a gorgeous tribute to this quintessential artist's artist. Rand's uncanny ability to inject wit and whimsy into the corporate vocabulary is echoed here, for example, in an enlarged reproduction of an opened children's book whose spine is aligned with that of the actual book held by the reader, creating a playful trompe l'oeil effect. At 255 pages, with a staggering 452 illustrations (over 300 in color), this book is a delightful and inspiring must-have. <i>--A.C. Smith</i></p>Steven Heller is Senior Art Director at The New York Times. He is also editor of the AIGA Journal of Graphic Design and co-chair MFA/Design Program of the School of Visual Arts in New York. He is author and co-author of numerous books including Graphic Style: From Victorian to Post-Modern and Graphic Wit and Design Literacy: Understanding Graphic Design. In 1996, Heller received the New York Art Directors&#39; Special Educator&#39;s Award. Armin Hofmann is one of Switzerland&#39;s foremost graphic designers who taught with Rand at Yale and at the Brissago Summer School. George Lois, wunderkind of American advertising, says he owes everything to Rand. In his own right, Lois is the first among equals in the creative revolution in US advertising - he was responsible for the original VW campaign - and no more eminent figure exists in the field. He is author of The Art of Advertising and his most recent book What&#39;s the Big Idea? (1991) was widely acclaimed. Jessica Helfand, a former Rand student at Yale, is the new-media columnist for Eye magazine and writes regularly for i-D, Print and the AIGA Journal on design issues.

David Marquet led a distinguished career in the U.S. submarine force. He commanded the nuclear-powered fast-attack submarine USS <i>Santa Fe</i>, stationed in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Captain Marquet completely turned around <i>Santa Fe</i>, where the crew went from being ''worst to first.'' <i>Santa Fe</i> earned numerous awards for being the most improved ship in the Pacific and the most combat-effective ship in the squadron. <i>Santa Fe</i> continued to win awards after his departure and promoted a disproportionate number of officers and enlisted men to positions of increased responsibility. After riding USS <i>Santa Fe</i>, noted author Stephen R. Covey said it was the most empowering organization he'd ever seen and wrote about Captain Marquet's leadership practices in his book, <i>The 8th Habit</i>.<p> His bold and highly effective leadership can be summarized as ''give control, create leaders.''

And in the pages that follow you will find a model for your pathway.'' --Stephen R. Covey</p><p> ''To say I'm a fan of David Marquet would be an understatement.... I'm a fully fledged groupie. He is the kind of leader who comes around only once a generation. He is the kind of leader who doesn't just know how to lead, he knows how to build leaders. His ideas and lessons are invaluable to anyone who wants to build an organization that will outlive them.'' --Simon Sinek, optimist and author of <i>Start with Why</i></p><p> ''How do we release the intellect and initiative of each member of the organization toward a common purpose? Here's the answer: With fascinating storytelling and a deep understanding of what motivates and inspires. David Marquet provides leaders in the military, business, and education a powerful vehicle that will delight, provoke, and encourage them to act.'' --Michael P. Peters, president of the St. John's College, <i>Santa Fe</i></p><p> ''I owe a lot to Captain David Marquet ... not only for turning the <i>Santa Fe</i> around during some REALLY bad times but I learned many lessons on leadership from him that have been invaluable in my post-Navy life.</p><p> I preach the three legs (control, competence, clarity) of Leader-Leader everyday to empower my people and move the decisions to where the information lives.... I used these principles to turn around the GE Dallas Generator Repair Department, which was in crisis when I arrived in 2010 and now is the best Generator Repair Department in the GE Network.... Now I am tasked with turning around the Dallas Steam Turbine Repair Department....'' --Adam McAnally, Steam Turbine Cell Leader at the GE Dallas Service Center and former crewmember, USS <i>Santa Fe</i></p><p> ''This terrific read actually provides new and valuable insights into how to lead. And nothing important gets done without leadership. Captain Marquet takes you through his life of learning how to lead, and presents you with a winning formula: not leader-follower, but leader-leader. It's about leading by getting others to take responsibility--and like it. It works for business, politics, and life.'' -- --Leslie H.

If you're an Organizational Behavior or Leadership expert or enthusiast this book can have a substantial impact on you and your organization s ability to meet its goals.'' -- Joe DeBono, Founder and President of MBA Corps and Merrill Lynch Wealth Manager</p><p> ''David Marquet's message in <i>Turn the Ship Around!</i> inspires the empowerment of engaged people and leadership at all levels. He encourages leaders to release energy, intellect, and passion in everyone around them. <i>Turn the Ship Around!</i> challenges the paradigm of the hierarchical organization by revealing the process to tear down pyramids, create a flat organization, and to develop leaders, not followers.'' --- Dale R. Wilson, Sr., business management professional, and editor/blogger at Command Performance Leadership (commandperformanceleadership.wordpress.com)<br><br>This is the story of Captain David Marquet's unprecedented experiment in the most rigid of environments on the Santa Fe, a U.S. Navy nuclear-powered submarine. He had the courage to operate counter-culture, reengineering the very definition of leadership accepted by the U.S. Navy for as long as it has existed. He took huge risk to do this. The outcome was revolutionary - within a few short months, the crew of the Santa Fe went from worst to first. In today's information age, Human Capital is our most precious resource. It is the 21stCentury weapon of choice. Captain David Marquet's experiment in leadership has far greater application to the entire business world. This is thought leadership. -- Charlie Kim, Founder &amp; CEO of Next Jump, Inc.</p><p> Leaders and managers face an increasingly complex world, where precise execution, teamwork and enabling of talent are competitive advantages. David Marquet provides a blue print, along with real-life examples and implementation mechanisms.

It was easy for your thoughts to drift when you were doing something you did every day&#x2014;such as driving down the Tlokweng Road, or spooning tea into the teapot while you waited for the kettle to boil, or standing in your garden look�ing up at the wide sky of Botswana. These were all activities that did not require total and undivided concentration, although her hus�band, that great <i>garagiste, </i>Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, stressed that driving demanded your whole attention. Mma Ramotswe, though, felt it was perfectly possible to drive carefully and yet at the same time let the mind wander. There was not a driver in the country, she imagined, who did not think of other things while driving&#x2014;unless of course there were, somewhere or other, people who had nothing at all to think about.<br>&nbsp;<br>That morning she thought of what she would cook for din�ner. She thought of letters she might receive and of the replies she should write. She thought of how she knew this road so well that she could drive it blindfold if necessary, and still get to her desti�nation unscathed, or largely unscathed. She thought of how month by month, year by year, the traffic had got worse, as traffic always seemed to do. Was there nowhere on this earth where traffic got better; where the lines of cars thinned; where one could park virtually anywhere, as one could in the old days? And she thought of the people in her life, the people she would see that day, and the people she would not.<br>&nbsp;<br>The people in her life . . . These, she felt, were of two sorts. Whatever further classifications might suggest themselves, at the outset people could be divided into those who were late and those who were still with us. The ranks of the late were legion, but each of us had a small number of late people who meant something special to us and whom we would always remember. She had never known her mother, who had died when she was still an infant, but her father, Obed Ramotswe, she had known well and still missed as much as ever. Every day she thought of him, of his kindness and his wisdom, of his ability to judge cattle&#x2014;and men&#x2014;with such a perceptive eye; of the love he had borne for her and of how his passing had been like the putting out of the sun itself.<br>&nbsp;<br>There were other late people, of course: there was Seretse Khama, first President of Botswana and patriot; there was Mma Makutsi&#x2019;s brother, Richard, who had been called to higher things&#x2014;as Mma Makutsi put it&#x2014;from his bed of sickness; there was her favourite aunt, whose cheerful and irreverent remarks had been a source of such joy; there was that unfortunate man in Mochudi who had stepped on a cobra; there were so many others.<br>&nbsp;<br>That was the group of late people. Then there was the other group, made up of those who were not late; who were, in some cases, only too obviously present, who touched her life in some way or other. These were her family, her friends, her colleagues, and finally those who were neither friends nor colleagues.<br>&nbsp;<br>She considered herself blessed with her family. Some people had family members who were always burdensome, who wanted things, who found fault, who complained about this, that, and the next thing. Or they had family members who were an embarrassment&#x2014;who prompted the making of comments such as, &#x201c;Well, he&#x2019;s not all that close a relative&#x2014;very distant, in fact,&#x201d; or even, &#x201c;We have the same name, yes, but I don&#x2019;t think we&#x2019;re related.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>She had no need to say any of that. She had a fine husband, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni. She had various aunts in villages outside Gaborone, she had several cousins whom she always enjoyed seeing; and of course she had the two children, Motholeli and Puso, who, although technically foster children, were considered by everybody, including Mma Ramotswe and Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, to be her own. She had lost a baby&#x2014;but that had been a long time ago, and in so far as one could ever get over such a thing, she had done so. She could now think of that baby without being overwhelmed by sorrow; she could think of the brief moment during which she had held her child, that tiny scrap of humanity, and of the inexpressible, overwhelming love she had felt. She could think of that now without her heart becoming a cold stone within her. <br>&nbsp;<br>To start with friends: prominent among these was Mma Sylvia Potokwane, matron and stout defender&#x2014;in every sense&#x2014;of the orphans entrusted to her care. Mma Ramotswe had known Mma Potokwane for many years and their friendship had been firm throughout, although she could not recall when, and in what circumstances, they had first met. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;But you must remember where you met her first,&#x201d; said Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni. &#x201c;She is not one of those people one could easily forget.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>That was, of course, true: Mma Potokwane was certainly not easily forgotten, but still Mma Ramotswe could not remember any occasion when somebody had said, &#x201c;Mma Ramotswe, this is Mma Potokwane.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I really do not remember, Rra,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I just feel that we have known one another forever. She has always been there&#x2014;like Kgali Hill or the Limpopo River. Do you remember the first time you saw Kgali Hill?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s quite different, Mma,&#x201d; he had said. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t compare Mma Potokwane to Kgali Hill.&#x201d; Mma Ramotswe considered this, and the more she thought about it, the more she felt that one <i>could </i>compare the redoubtable matron to Kgali Hill. Both were solid; both were unchanging; both would not be budged from where they stood. <br>&nbsp;<br>Of course there were other friends&#x2014;Mma Ramotswe was well known in Gaborone and could rarely make a trip to the shops without bumping into somebody she knew, and most of these would be friends of one sort or another. There were old friends whom she had known all her life&#x2014;people with whom she had grown up in Mochudi&#x2014;and there were newer friends, those whom she had met during her years in Gaborone: neighbours, friends of friends, fellow attenders at the Anglican Cathedral, members of the Botswana Ladies&#x2019; Winter Blanket Committee. This last group met in the months immediately preceding winter and planned fundraising events for their annual blanket appeal. People forgot that Botswana had a winter and that there would be people, poor people, who felt the cold. Just because a country was drenched in sunlight did not mean that the temperature could not drop when the sun went down, especially on the fringes of the Kalahari. On a winter night, with the sky clear and filled with white fields of stars, the cold might penetrate to your very bones, as a dry cold can so easily do. And that was when you needed blankets to wrap yourself in, to make a cocoon of warmth to see you through to the morning. <br>&nbsp;<br>So there were the ladies of the Blanket Committee, and they were all her good friends, as were the ladies who attended to her at the supermarket bakery and who always kept the freshest bread for Mma Ramotswe, even though she protested that she did not want any special treatment and would take her chances like anybody else. Then there was the man in the Vehicle Licensing Department who invariably clapped his hands with delight when Mma Ramotswe came in to attend to business on behalf of Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, and who would shout out, &#x201c;My favourite lady has just come into the office! Oh, this is a very happy day for the Vehicle Licensing Department!&#x201d; That had embarrassed her at first, but she had become accustomed to it and took it in her stride, laughing along with her admirer&#x2019;s col�leagues. She realized that if you worked in the Vehicle Licensing Department, then you might need your moments of levity, and if she could provide those just by stepping in through the door, then she was happy to do so.<br>&nbsp;<br>Friends were different from colleagues, of course, although col�leagues could also be friends. Being self- employed, Mma Ramotswe did not have a large number of colleagues; in fact, she only had one full- time, permanent colleague, so to speak, although she had a part- time colleague in the shape of Mr. Polopetsi and another, if one took a liberal view of the definition, in the shape of Charlie. Fanwell, the former apprentice and now assistant mechanic, was not really a col�league in the strict sense, as he worked in the adjacent garage owned by Mma Ramotswe&#x2019;s husband and was really Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni&#x2019;s colleague rather than hers.<br>&nbsp;<br>The full- time colleague was, as everybody knew, Mma Makutsi&#x2014;Grace Makutsi, former secretary, graduate <i>magna cum laude </i>of the Botswana Secretarial College, where she achieved the mark of ninety- seven per cent in the final examinations; born in the remote and unexceptional town of Bobonong; survivor . . . Yes, Mma Makutsi had every right to be called a survivor. She had survived poverty; she had survived the battle for an education; she had lived with a slightly difficult skin and with the necessity of large spectacles; she had struggled for everything she possessed; and at last her ship had come home, unambiguously and magnificently, when she had met and married Mr. Phuti Radiphuti, a kind man, and a wealthy one too, being the proprietor of the Double Comfort Furniture Store. And together they had had a baby, Itumelang Clovis Radiphuti, a fine young son, and the only purring baby in Botswana.<br><br>That was Mma Makutsi, and Mma Ramotswe, thinking of her now, could only smile at her ways, which were well known, and per�fectly tolerable once you became used to them. Mr. Polopetsi, her part- time colleague, was in awe of Mma Makutsi. He was a very mild man, a chemist with a chequered career, who worked in the agency on a voluntary basis because he needed something to do. He had now found a job as a part- time chemistry teacher at Gaborone Secondary School, a job that brought in very little money as it rarely required more than a few hours of his time each week. But the pay did not matter: his wife, a senior civil servant, was the main breadwinner. She preferred her husband to be occupied, and so was happy for him to spend his time on his poorly paid teaching job and his unpaid detective work in the agency.<br><br>And it suited the agency too. &#x201c;Mr. Polopetsi may not be a great detective,&#x201d; observed Mma Makutsi. &#x201c;But he does understand the sci�entific method and the need for evidence. That is important, Mma Ramotswe.&#x201d;<br><br>Charlie, by contrast, understood very little&#x2014;at least in Mma Makutsi&#x2019;s view. He had been an apprentice in the garage, but had lost his job when Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni had been obliged to cut staff. That had been done only when all other avenues had been explored; money was tight, and many cars were now being taken to the larger garages where their complicated needs could be addressed by spe�cialist equipment.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;They are not making cars for people any longer,&#x201d; said Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni. &#x201c;They are making them for computers. If something goes wrong, they just take out the part and throw it away. Nobody can fix anything these days.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Charlie had his faults. He was impetuous, being given to mak�ing inflammatory remarks in the presence of Mma Makutsi, and his thoughts seemed to dwell almost exclusively on girls. In spite of all this, though, Mma Ramotswe had been unwilling to see him cast adrift and had employed him in the agency as what Mma Makutsi insisted on calling a Junior Probationary Apprentice Detective. Her insistence on this humiliating title rankled with Charlie, but he was grateful for such scraps of status as the job gave him, and even Mma Makutsi had to admit that he was making an effort. There was a long way to go, though, and she was watching him. Those, then, were the categories of friends and colleagues. That left those who were neither friends nor colleagues, a group that in turn was divided into those who were simply unknown&#x2014;people who clearly existed but who had yet to be met&#x2014;and those who were known. It was this last set that was most delicate and troublesome, as it embraced those whom some might assume were enemies. That was not a word that Mma Ramotswe liked. She did not think of others in this way, as from an early age she had been imbued with the message that one should love one&#x2019;s enemies, and if one loved one&#x2019;s enemies then surely they ceased to be enemies. That message of love had been taught at Sunday School in Mochudi, when, along with thirty other children, the young Precious Ramotswe had been taught to recite the precepts of the good life. You respected your father and mother, along with a large number of others including teachers, elderly people, government officials, and policemen. You were not greedy, envious, or impatient, although you might feel all of these with some regularity. You never cast the first stone nor did you notice the mote in your neighbor&#x2019;s eye when you so clearly had a plank in your own. And of course you forgave your enemies. Mma Ramotswe had tried to live according to these rules, and had, for the most part, succeeded. But if asked whether there was anybody who might be unfriendly towards her, she had to admit that yes, there was somebody to whom that description might be applied, although she had not asked for her enmity and had never sought to perpetuate it. This person, Violet Sephotho, was regrettably an opponent, but only because she&#x2014;not Mma Ramotswe&#x2014;had decided to adopt that position, and were peace to be offered Mma Ramotswe would willingly accede. And there was another thing: although this person was hostile to Mma Ramotswe, her real target was Mma Makutsi, who had no compunction at all in declaring that between her and Violet Sephotho there existed a state of hostility that was to all intents and purposes undeclared war.<br>&nbsp;<br>Violet Sephotho had been at the Botswana Secretarial College at the same time as Mma Makutsi. Their respective attitudes towards the college could not have been more different: for Mma Makutsi the college represented the Parnassus to which she had long aspired&#x2014;the institution that would deliver her from her life of poverty and struggle and equip her for a career in an office. For that she was pro�foundly and unconditionally grateful. She was completely committed to her studies the day they began; she never missed a lecture, and always occupied a seat in the front row; she completed every exercise and assignment on time and absorbed every piece of advice given by her tutors. At lectures she listened in respectful silence, writing everything down in the blue- bound notebooks that cost more than she could really afford&#x2014;the purchase of a new notebook meant no lunch for a week; buying a textbook meant the forgoing of transport for at least a month. And when she graduated, on that unforgettable day, amidst the ululations of the proud aunts, she swore to herself that she would never forget the debt of gratitude she owed to the col�lege and its staff.<br>&nbsp;<br>Violet Sephotho felt none of this loyalty. She had taken up her place at the college because nothing else had turned up. Her exami�nation results at school were indifferent, and had she applied to the University of...</p></p><h2>Deeper than Indigo: Tracing Thomas Machell, Forgotten Explorer</h2><p>The author&#x2019;s quest begins when the word &#x2018;indigo&#x2019; draws her to the illustrated journals, now in the British Library, of Victorian explorer Thomas Machell. She finds her life to have striking echoes of his, not least his travels to and within India, a career in indigo, and a passion for journal writing. She is also intrigued by his aspiration to write &#x2018;a novel in the form of an autobiography&#x2019; and by his quirky watercolor sketches. Machell of Crackenthorpe, born in 1824, first demonstrated his yearning for adventure when only twelve, and at sixteen left the family rectory to follow his dream of traveling to the East. By chance, he witnessed many important historical events, including the infamous &#x2018;First Opium War&#x2019; and the &#x2018;Indian Mutiny&#x2019;. He spent most of his adult life in India; the author follows him to indigo plantations of rural Bengal and Bangladesh, to coffee estates in Kerala&#x2019;s Malabar Hills, to unexplored regions of central India and to the city of Calcutta. Machell also traveled up the Indus River to Kashmir and the North-West Frontier and undertook an intrepid sea voyage with Muslim merchants. When the author voyages aboard the last freighter to take passengers from UK to India, she faces the same threat of pirate attack in the Red Sea as Machell. She also follows in his wake by cargo ship to the most remote Polynesian islands, setting for his passionate love affair, and she seeks his colorful descendants in the New World. This remarkable tale of East-West connections brings to life the untold story of a spirited outsider at the height of the British Raj. Serendipity, intuition and an enchanting relationship, as well as the author&#x2019;s quest to uncover the missing years of Machell&#x2019;s life, give this book its magical extra dimension. Thomas Machell, explorer, writer and artist, was born near York in 1824. As a teenager he sailed around the Cape of Good Hope to India and on to China where he experienced the &#x2018;First Opium War&#x2019;. His next voyage was around Cape Horn to the Polynesian Islands of the Marquesas, on a ship carrying coal and guano. Returning to India, he worked in indigo in Bengal, coffee in Kerala and with bullock transport in central India. He also traveled up the Indus to the North-West Frontier and Kashmir and in the Arab world by land and by sea with Muslim merchants. He died in India in 1864, aged 39.</p><p>Jenny Balfour Paul A writer, artist, international lecturer and intrepid traveller, she is author of two books on Indigo, and numerous other writings.

Though the volume of all this larceny increases in good times, only during a financial crisis does its full magnitude come to light. Every period of economic turmoil throws up its signature crook. It may be too early to select today's emblematic fraudster, but I suspect that, when the votes are finally in, Bernie Madoff will walk away with the prize. During the stock market crash of 2000-01, the name to reckon with turned out not to be that of an individual but a whole company, Enron. And the man who more than anyone else came to epitomize the global crisis that began in 1929 and culminated in the Great Depression was Ivar Kreuger. "The Match King," by Frank Partnoy, is the story of Kreuger. Starting out in the match business in Sweden, he emerged on the European financial scene in the early 1920s when he decided to branch out into international banking. After World War I, most countries had a hard time borrowing in international capital markets. Kreuger decided to exploit his position as a leading European businessman by acting as a go-between, raising capital in New York and lending it to countries desperate for dollars. In return, he required from each borrowing nation a monopoly over the manufacture of matches. Among the governments with which he struck such deals were those of Ecuador, Peru, Poland, Greece, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Romania and even France and Germany. By 1929 he had reputedly become the third-richest man in the world. Even when the Great Crash hit, he seemed to weather the storm reasonably well, successfully completing a $125-million deal with Germany at the end of 1929. But as the stock market kept falling, Kreuger found it more and more difficult to raise capital. Rumors spread that his accounts were riddled with inconsistencies and that he was being investigated by Swedish authorities. He was able to stave off bankruptcy only when $100 million in Italian government bonds miraculously appeared in his safe. On March 12, 1932, the public woke up to the news that he had shot himself through the heart in Paris. A few weeks later the Italian bonds were revealed to be forgeries. All of which makes for a fascinating story. Partnoy, a former investment banker, now a professor of law at the University of San Diego, does a yeoman's job of leading us through the various financial machinations that kept the Kreuger empire afloat. Along the way, much is made of how Kreuger manipulated his auditor, a hapless, almost comical New Yorker by the name of Albert D. Berning, whom Kreuger alternately charmed, bullied and bribed not to ask too many questions. But what goes on between a man and his accountant is poor raw material for drama. When it comes to financial crimes, the general reader is interested less in the complex mechanics of how they are committed than in the personality of the criminal. The fascination of someone like Madoff, for example, lies not in how he fabricated his transactions but in trying to get behind that sphinx-like smile to unmask the man who was able to sustain so vast a lie for so long. Kreuger was no less interesting. He had six or seven residences, a hotel suite in London, apartments in Berlin, New York and Paris, through which he supposedly rotated a string of mistresses. From his office he would try to impress visitors by apparently fielding calls from Mussolini and Stalin -- all of them, it turned out, bogus. In an interview with the Saturday Evening Post, he declared that he owed his success to three things: "One is silence; the second is more silence; while the third is still more silence." While Partnoy takes us through a maze of accounting shenanigans -- off-balance sheet debts, nonvoting shares, the network of offshore companies through which all the money was funneled around the world -- for most of this book Kreuger remains a lifeless figure, an unfortunate victim of the author's clunky and clich�-ridden prose, which sometimes reads like a Harlequin romance. Here, for example, is Kreuger's first meeting with his accountant: "Ivar met A.D. Berning and the men looked into each other's eyes. Ivar couldn't have been more pleased." Only in the last couple of chapters, as Kreuger spends days on end locked in his private suite, muttering and nerving himself to suicide, does Partnoy finally seem to find his voice and partially succeed in bringing this infamous swindler to life. <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

We long for what nature can reveal, the essential truths that connect us to the core of life itself. Following the spiritual philosophy of the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico, who have been her teachers for over thirty years, Nancy Wood shares her awareness and appreciation of the complex, magical world around us. These poems and meditations, following the Twelve Great Paths of the Moon, reveal old, enduring truths that may help each of us on our journey.</p><p>Grade 7 Up?Wood has organized her cycle of poems in homage to Native American philosophy around the Twelve Great Paths of the Moon of the Pueblo Indians. Each section is preceded by a meditation (January's Man Moon begins?"January's great path of the moon is solitude. Each day is part of an infinite puzzle, interlocked with all the preceding days and the ones that follow."). Within the section, each poem is accompanied by a stunning painting that is also inspired by Native American mythology. The book is visually gripping and gorgeous; its clean typeface and sharp white borders set off perfectly both paintings and text. Unfortunately, while Wood clearly has a deep devotion to and respect for Native American philosophy, as she so eloquently demonstrated in War Cry on a Prayer Feather (Doubleday, 1979; o.p.), her own words in this collection ring more of New Ageisms that seep into adult conversations than poetry. She writes in "Invitation to Life"?"I invite you to life/and you send regrets...I'll issue no more invitations/to you. The party's been/ cancelled, the guests won't arrive/in time to find me having/A dance all my own. You see,/I invited myself to my life/and finally accepted." This book, although written with noble intentions, should be declined.?Kathleen Whalin, Greenwich Country Day School, CT<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Woods' own poems accompany paintings by Frank Howell in this fine collection, based on Native American wisdom. It's difficult to assign an age level to this collection, but kids at the middle school level and many an adult will find it absorbing and varied. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>Maverick (Elite Ops, Book 2)</h2><p><p>Micah Sloane knows almost everything there is to know about Risa Clay, including the vicious betrayal she endured years ago and the distrust she's harbored ever since.

Not only did it win the $100 prize, but, published anonymously, it marked the first in the series of "blood &amp; thunder tales" that would be her livelihood for years.<p> In <em>Behind a Mask,</em> editor Madeleine Stern introduces four Alcott thrillers: "Pauline's Passion and Punishment," "The Mysterious Key," "The Abbot's Ghost," and the title story, "Behind a Mask." First published in one volume in 1975, they are regarded as Alcott's finest work in this genre.</p></p><p><p>Louisa May Alcott (1832-1888) is the author of the beloved <em>Little Women</em>, which was based on her own experiences growing up in New England with her parents and three sisters. More than a century after her death, Louisa May Alcott's stories continue to delight readers of all ages.</p>Before she could get breath for another complaint, the clock struck seven and the doorbell rang. <p> "There she is!" cried Bella, and turned toward the door as if to go and meet the newcomer. But Lucia arrested her, saying authoritatively, "Stay here, child. It is her place to come to you, not yours to go to her." </p><p> "Miss Muir," announced a servant, and a little black-robed figure stood in the doorway. For an instant no one stirred, and the governess had time to see and be seen before a word was uttered. All looked at her, and she cast on the household group a keen glance that impressed them curiously; then her eyes fell, and bowing slightly she walked in. Edward came forward and received her with the frank cordiality which nothing could daunt or chill. "Mother, this is the lady whom you expected. Miss Muir, allow me to apologize for our apparent neglect in not sending for you. There was a mistake about the carriage, or, rather, the lazy fellow to whom the order was given forgot it. Bella, come here." </p><p> "Thank you, no apology is needed. I did not expect to be sent for." And the governess meekly sat down without lifting her eyes. </p><p> "I am glad to see you. Let me take your things," said Bella, rather shyly, for Gerald, still lounging, watched the fireside group with languid interest, and Lucia never stirred. Mrs. Coventry took a second survey and began: </p><p> "You were punctual, Miss Muir, which pleases me. I'm a sad invalid, as Lady Sydney told you, I hope; so that Miss Coventry's lessons will be directed by my niece, and you will go to her for directions, as she knows what I wish. You will excuse me if I ask you a few questions, for Lady Sydney's note was very brief, and I left everything to her judgment." "Ask anything you like, madam," answered the soft, sad voice. </p><p> "You are Scotch, I believe." </p><p> "Yes, madam." </p><p> "Are your parents living?" </p><p> "I have not a relation in the world." </p><p> "Dear me, how sad! Do you mind telling me your age?" </p><p> "Nineteen." And a smile passed over Miss Muir's lips, as she folded her hands with an air of resignation, for the catechism was evidently to be a long one.</p></p><h2>The Best American Science And Nature Writing 2009</h2><p>Elizabeth Kolbert, one of today's leading environmental journalists,&nbsp;edits this year's volume of the finest science and nature writing. Bringing together&nbsp;promising&nbsp;new voices&nbsp;and prize-winning favorites, this&nbsp;collection is "a delight for any fan of popular science" (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>).</p><p>Elizabeth Kolbert was a political reporter for the New York Times for fourteen years before joining the New Yorker in 1999. Her series on global warming, &#34;The Climate of Man,&#34; was awarded the American Association for the Advancement of Science&#39;s magazine writing award. Her stories have also appeared in The New York Times Magazine, Vogue, and Mother Jones. She is the author of Field Notes from a Catastrophe. Tim Folger is a contributing editor at Discover and writes about science for several magazines.Starred Review. With 26 essays collected from 15 publications, <i>New Yorker</i> contributor Kolbert (<i>Field Notes from a Catastrophe</i>) has pulled together a magnificent display of writing. There's not a weak piece in the bunch. Kolbert's choices provide a sense of major themes in science today, with five pieces focused on evolution and seven on environmental topics. As Kolbert notes, Darwin's ideas seem ever more central to our culture, even as their implications continue to challenge us. As Benjamin Phelan shows, there's controversy even among biologists about some aspects of evolution, such as whether humans are still evolving today; Phelan presents the evidence that we are. John Broome discusses the ethics of climate change while Michael Specter is insightful on the difficulties of measuring one's carbon footprint; he concludes counterintuitively that, in many cases, it may make more environmental sense to purchase imported food than to buy locally. Other entries show what might have been prior to the Big Bang, the use of virtual reality games to quell post-traumatic stress disorder in Iraqi War veterans and much more.

But eventually the manuscript was tucked away in a drawer and forgotten. Lois went on to attend Furman University and studied music for several years in New York City where she and her sister sang professionally. Some years ago, Lois was prompted to pull that old manuscript out and began to work on Mandie&#39;s story-of her childhood in the South at the turn of the century and her Cherokee heritage. The rest is history and now the MANDIE BOOKS series have sales nearing six million copies! Lois writes from her home in South Carolina. Enthusiastic young fans fill her mailbox with their insightful responses to her stories.Grade 4-7. Leppard is the prolific author of nearly 30 mysteries about Mandie Shaw, set in the American South around the turn of this century. In this latest offering, it's 1901 and Mandie's father has died, leaving the house to the 13 year old. However, her mean stepmother, who has remarried, appears with what she claims is a will leaving the house to her. The document naming Mandie as heir is missing; the girl and her friend must find it. Mandie is prissy and unbelievably good. The demeaning portrayal of black servants and a Native American, all of whom speak in dialect, adds to the stilted, distracting quality of the writing. The plot is overly complicated and confusing, with unclear allusions to what has transpired in past books, and some subplots, such as one about a ruby mine, that add nothing to the story at hand. The sense of urgency and suspense around finding the original will is diminished halfway through the book when Mandie's stepfather reveals that no matter what happens legally, he will purchase the home for Mandie. The ending is too neat and weak, with anticipation of a trip to New York City and therefore a new book about the heroine. This series is considered Christian fiction but, except for Mandie reciting a favorite Bible verse when she is afraid, the Christian values are unclear.?Connie Tyrrell Burns, Mahoney Middle School, South Portland, ME<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Zella, Zack, and Zodiac</h2><p>Zella the zebra helps Zack the ostrich when he is young and helpless. When he grows up Zack returns the favor by saving Zella&#39;s young offspring from a lion.</p><p>Bill Peet was the author of 34 books published by Houghton Mifflin. One of these, BILL PEET: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY, was named a 1989 Caldecott Honor Book. All of Bill Peet&#x2019;s books published by Houghton Mifflin Company, including his first book for children published in 1959, HUBERT'S HAIR-RAISING ADVENTURE, remain actively in print today.<br><br>In both his career as an author and illustrator of children&#x2019;s books and in his work as sketch artist and continuity illustrator at Walt Disney, Bill Peet created a menagerie of memorable characters. As he himself noted, "I write about animals because I love to draw them. Most of my animal characters have human personalities, and some are much like the people I know."<br><br>At Walt Disney, where Bill Peet worked for 27 years, he was a key participant in the production of classic films such as Fantasia, Sleeping Beauty, Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, and 101 Dalmatians for which he was not only an artist, but the screenwriter as well. <br><br>Bill Peet&#x2019;s signature style enabled him to create fast-paced stories of fantastical adventure delivered with warmth and laugh-out-loud hilarity. His unfailing humor did not, however, prevent him from addressing such poignant issues as kindness toward others and respect for the environment. Through the exploits of his characters, Peet offered his audience a chance to see themselves and their world through new eyes.<br><br>"At some point," Bill Peet once said, "it occurred to me that drawing was something I couldn&#x2019;t possibly give up, and somehow it must be turned into a profession." He went on to not only fulfill his dream but to introduce generations of young readers to his delightful vision of humor, friendship and compassion.<br>Kindergarten-Grade 3 Reminiscent of Dr. Seuss' Horton Hatches the Egg (Random, 1940), Peet's book tells of a baby ostrich, Zack, who is abandoned by his mother and adopted by a maternal zebra, Zella. Zack eventually grows into a tall bird, towering over the zebra herd. When Zella gives birth to a clumsy, big-footed male named Zodiac, whose inability to run fast hampers his safety from carnivorous animals, Zack becomes his "brotherly bodyguard." Written in Peet's usual nonsensical and poetic fashion, this story appears to be wordy and preposterous at times yet comical in its own endearing way. Colored crayon and pencil drawings accompany the text, increasing the humor of the tale. The uncluttered illustrations, showing animals and wide expanses of sky and grass, make the story especially suitable for reading aloud to primary grade listeners.

"The criminal element" is the enemy. Repression and restraint are the primary tools of criminal justice, and criminologists study how to make those tools effective in the "war on crime." We are beginning to realize that this is a war against ourselves and one that we are losing. Our inability to make peace with crime and criminals is reflected in the paucity of our daily personal relations, where we live by domination and discipline, where forgiveness and mercy are seen as naive surrender to victimization. </p><p>The essays in this volume propose peacemaking as an effective alternative to the "war" on crime. They range from studies of the intellectual roots of the peacemaking tradition to concrete examples of peacemaking in the community, with special attention to feminist peacemmaking traditions and women's experience. </p></p><p></p><h2>Patriotism</h2><p>&#34;Was it death he was now waiting for?

Influenced by European literature, in which he was exceptionally well read, he was an interpreter to his own people of Japan&#39;s ancient virtues, to which he urged a return. He had sung on the stage, starred in and directed movies and was a noted practitioner of Japan&#39;s traditional martial arts.

Born in 1929, Anne Frank received a blank diary on her 13th birthday, just weeks before she and her family went into hiding in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam. Her marvelously detailed, engagingly personal entries chronicle 25 trying months of claustrophobic, quarrelsome intimacy with her parents, sister, a second family, and a middle-aged dentist who has little tolerance for Anne's vivacity. The diary's universal appeal stems from its riveting blend of the grubby particulars of life during wartime (scant, bad food; shabby, outgrown clothes that can't be replaced; constant fear of discovery) and candid discussion of emotions familiar to every adolescent (everyone criticizes me, no one sees my real nature, when will I be loved?). Yet Frank was no ordinary teen: the later entries reveal a sense of compassion and a spiritual depth remarkable in a girl barely 15. Her death epitomizes the madness of the Holocaust, but for the millions who meet Anne through her diary, it is also a very individual loss. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>For almost fifty years, Anne Frank&#39;s diary has moved millions with its testament to the human spirit&#39;s indestructibility, but readers have never seen the full text of this beloved book--until now. This new translation, performed by Winona Ryder, restores nearly one third of Anne&#39;s entries excised by her father in previous editions, revealing her burgeoning sexuality, her stormy relationship with her mother, and more.</p><h2>Henry Huggins (Henry Huggins, 1)</h2><p><p><strong>In the first novel from Newbery Medal&#x2013;winning author Beverly Cleary, boys and girls alike will instantly be charmed by an average boy whose life is turned upside down when he meets a lovable puppy with a nose for mischief.</strong> </p><p>Just as Henry Huggins is complaining that nothing exciting ever happens, a friendly dog sits down beside him and looks pleadingly at his ice-cream cone. From that moment on, the two are inseparable. But when Ribsy's original owner appears, trying to reclaim his dog, Henry's faced with the possibility of losing his new best friend. Has Klickitat Street seen the last of rambunctious Ribsy?</p></p><p>Nothing ever happens to Henry Huggins. Nothing, that is, until a stray dog named Ribsy comes into his life. Pretty soon, Henry and Ribsy are wreaking havoc on the city bus, getting a ride in a police car with sirens wailing, and winning a prize at the dog show. Thanks to their joint shenanigans, Henry finds himself covered in green paint one day, and later accidentally colors Ribsy's fur pale pink. One week, Henry catches earthworms for his fisherman neighbor to raise money for a borrowed ball Ribsy helped him lose. One football costs a lot of earthworms--1,395, to be exact. Plus 41 worms for tax. Life is no longer dull.<p> Beverly Cleary's lively, award-winning books virtually shout "good, old-fashioned fun!"

They`re both popular, smart, and gorgeous, but that's where the similarity ends. Elizabeth is friendly, outgoing, and sincere -- nothing like her snobbish and conniving twin. Jessica gets what she wants -- at school, with friends, and especially with boys.<br><br>This time, Jessica has set her sights on Todd Wilkins, the handsome star of the basketball team -- the one boy that Elizabeth really likes. Elizabeth doesn't want to lose him, but what Jessica wants, Jessica usually gets... even if it ends up hurting her sister.<br><br>Meet the Wakefield twins, their guys, and the rest of the gang at Sweet Valley High....</p><p>Chapter<br>1<br>"Okay, when did I get so hideous?" Jessica Wakefield groaned. She leaned in toward her bedroom mirror as her twin sister, Elizabeth, rolled her eyes. "Seriously, Liz, it's like somebody snuck into my room last night and whacked me with the ugly stick."<br>"Yeah. That happened," Elizabeth said, digging through a pile of clothes on Jessica's bed.<br>"I'm totally serious!" Jessica protested. "First of all, I gained, like, five pounds since last week-all in my hips and butt," she said, turning around and craning her neck to see her rear view in the mirror. Her perfect-size-four rear view. "And I hate my hair. I mean, that new shampoo I bought did none of the things it was supposed to do. I'm all split ends and frizz."<br>"Uh-huh," Liz said disinterestedly.<br>"Plus I've got a zit! A huge one! Look at this thing, Liz! It's the zit that ate Sweet Valley!"<br>Jessica got right up in her sister's face.<br>"You're right, Jess," Liz said flatly. "You're completely deformed. You should definitely stay home from school today."<br>Jessica's face crumpled and she collapsed face-first on her unmade bed. "You suck."<br>"What? I'm just agreeing with you."<br>"Fine. Just leave me here to rot. I'm not fit for normal society."<br>Elizabeth laughed and pulled her sister back up, maneuvering her in front of the mirror, where they stood side by side. With their shoulder-length blond hair, blue-green eyes, and perfect California tans, Elizabeth and Jessica were exact duplicates of one another, down to the tiny dimples in their left cheeks when they smiled. Each wore a gold lavaliere around her neck-matching presents from their parents on their sixteenth birthday last June. The only way anyone who didn't know them very well could tell them apart was by the tiny beauty mark on Elizabeth's right shoulder. Those who did know them well knew that Elizabeth's style was more sophisticated and preppy, while Jessica's was up-to-the-minute trendy. Plus Elizabeth always wore a watch, while Jessica did not. Time was never a problem for Jessica. She always felt that things didn't really start until she arrived.<br>"Look at me," Elizabeth said to her twin, who did as she was told. "Now look at you." Jessica did. "If you're hideous, then I'm hideous too. Are you calling me hideous?"<br>Jessica's brow knitted. "You're a freak, you know that?"<br>"Yeah. A freak who can't find her new white sweater," Elizabeth said, returning to her search. "Where did you say you put it?"<br>Jessica hadn't said. Because she'd worn it without asking and spilled marinara sauce down the front, then forgotten to wash it right away. The stain had set, and now the sweater was ruined beyond all hope. She was just opening her mouth to plead ignorance when the phone rang.<br>"I got it!" she cried, grabbing the phone from her bedside table. "Hello?"<br>She took the phone out into the hallway to avoid her sister's growing impatience. Why didn't the girl just give up already and wear something else? Liz could be so stubborn sometimes.<br>"Hey, Liz? Or is this Jessica?" a boy's voice asked.<br>"It's Jessica," she replied. Hmmm. A call from a guy before the first school bell had rung. Her day was looking up already.<br>"Oh, hey, Jess. It's Todd."<br>Todd Wilkins? Even better. Todd was one of the most coveted guys in school. Tall, dark, and yum.<br>"Hey. What's up?" she asked, leaning back against the wall with a smile. Jessica had never really considered Todd before, but hey, if he was calling her, maybe he deserved a spare thought. Or two.<br>"Not much. Is Liz there?" he asked.<br>Instantly, the smile was gone. He was calling for Liz? The star wide receiver of the football team, captain of the basketball team, a shoo-in for best-looking and most popular, was calling for her brainiac sister? What was this, some kind of reality-show prank?<br>&nbsp;"Actually, she's kind of busy right now," Jessica said, taking a few steps away from her bedroom. "Spell-checking her latest marathon paper, of course. Such a nerd. So, how's the team? I saw that insane catch you made at practice the other day. ESPN highlight reel all the way."<br>Get him talking about himself, Jessica thought. Guys love that.<br>"You saw that?" The blush was evident in Todd's voice. Jessica glowed with triumph.<br>"Are you kidding? I practically missed my dismount because of it," Jessica told him. "Didn't you hear me cheering? I stopped practice and everything." It also couldn't hurt to remind him that she was captain of the cheerleading squad that went all out to support him every week.<br>"Thanks. That's . . . uh . . . thanks," Todd stammered.<br>"Can't wait for the first game," Jessica said happily. She just loved to make guys nervous. "I bet you'll have college scouts coming out for you in no time."<br>"I don't know about that, but thanks," Todd said humbly.<br>Jessica smiled. Sometimes she was so good she could hardly believe it herself. Two seconds of flattery and the guy had forgotten all about Liz. Boys were so predictable.<br>"Anyway, do you think you could see if Liz is free yet?" he asked.<br>Jessica frowned. Okay, maybe not totally predictable. "Oh, you know what? She just got in the shower."<br>"I could wait," Todd said hopefully.<br>Jessica forced a laugh. "Are you kidding? She'll be <br>in there forever. Liz takes the longest showers." Big <br>lie. Jessica was actually the hot-water hog of the family. In fact, Elizabeth usually had to take short showers because the hot water stopped half a minute in, thanks to Jessica.<br>Todd took a deep breath. "All right, then. I guess I'll just . . . talk to her later. Could you tell her I called?"<br>"No problem!" Jessica said. "See you in school!"<br>"Yeah. See ya."<br>Jessica hung up the phone and rolled her eyes. Todd Wilkins calling for Liz? What a joke. Elizabeth probably didn't even know Todd existed. She was way too serious for a gorgeous athlete like him.<br>"Who was that?" Elizabeth asked when Jessica traipsed back into her room. She had two neatly folded piles of Jessica's clothes in front of her now-clothes that had been strewn all over the room five minutes ago.<br>"Todd Wilkins," Jessica replied, tossing the phone onto her bed. "I don't know why he didn't call my cell. I'm sure he has the number."<br>Elizabeth paused midfold. "Todd called you?"<br>"Yeah. Guess he just couldn't wait another half hour to talk to me in school," Jessica said with a shrug, turning toward her reflection again.<br>"Oh." Elizabeth attacked another mountain of clothes, tearing through them like a tornado.<br>"Liz? What's wrong?" Jessica asked, staring at her sister in the mirror. She was whipping clothes at the bed as if they'd somehow offended her.<br>"What's wrong is I wish you'd stop taking my stuff without asking," Elizabeth blurted out.<br>Jessica rolled her eyes as she turned around. "So borrow something of mine if you want. I have white sweaters too, you know."<br>"That's not the point," Elizabeth said, irritated.<br>"Then what is the point?" Jessica asked.<br>"The point is . . . ," Elizabeth said, looking around at the mess. "The point is . . ." Finally, her shoulders slumped. She took a deep breath and sighed. "Just forget it. I'll wear something else."<br>She turned and walked out of Jessica's room, stepping over a pile of stuff on the way out the door. Jessica shook her head at her sister's back as she went. Liz really was way too possessive of her things.<br>Todd Wilkins. Huh, Jessica thought. We would look pretty hot together.<br>With one last fluff of her hair and a quick, appreciative glance at her reflection-hideousness forgotten-Jessica grabbed her books and headed downstairs for breakfast. There was nothing that put her in a good mood faster than the thought of a brand-new conquest.</p><h2>Romans: The Reign of Grace (Romans 5:1-8:39) (Expositional Commentary)</h2><p>The Boice Commentary series combines careful scholarship and clear communication in a verse-by-verse and section by section reading of various biblical texts.

The name suits it, because it is sleek and fast, and it moves with cunning and agility, and, above all, it is a supremely efficient killer of its prey.</p><p>A pair of Black Sharks emerged from a predawn fog bank and shot through the moonless sky at two hundred knots, just ten meters above the hard earth of the valley floor. Together they raced through the dark in a tight, staggered formation with their outboard lights extinguished. They flew nap-of-the-earth, following a dry streambed through the valley, skirting thirty kilometers to the northwest of Argvani, the nearest major village here in western Dagestan.</p><p>The KA-50s&#x2019; contra-rotating coaxial rotors chopped the thin mountain air. The unique twin-rotor design negated the need for a tail rotor, and this made these aircraft faster, as more of the engine&#x2019;s power could then be applied to propulsion, and it also made these aircraft less susceptible to ground fire, as it reduced by one the points on the big machine where a hit will cause a devastating malfunction.</p><p>This trait, along with other redundant systems&#x2014;a self-sealing fuel tank, and an airframe built partially from composites, including Kevlar&#x2014;makes the Black Shark an exceptionally hearty combat weapon, but as strong as the KA-50 is, it is equally deadly. The two helos streaking toward their target in Russia&#x2019;s North Caucasus had a full load-out of air-to-ground munitions: Each carried four hundred fifty 30-millimeter rounds for their underbelly cannon, forty 80-millimeter unguided finned rockets loaded into two outboard pods, and a dozen AT-16 guided air-to-ground missiles hanging off two outboard pylons.</p><p>These two KA-50s were Nochny (night) models, and they were comfortable in the black. As they closed on their objective, only the pilots&#x2019; night-vision equipment, their ABRIS Moving Map Display, and their FLIR (Forward-Looking Infrared Radar) kept the helos from slamming into each other, the sheer rock walls on either side of the valley, or the undulating landscape below.</p><p>The lead pilot checked his time to target, then spoke into his headset&#x2019;s microphone. <i>&#x201c;Semi minute.&#x201d;</i> Seven minutes. </p><p><i>&#x201c;Ponial&#x201d;</i>&#x2014;Got it&#x2014;came the reply from the Black Shark behind him.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>I</b>n the village that would burn in seven minutes, the roosters slept.</p><p>There, in a barn at the center of the cluster of buildings on the rocky hillside, Israpil Nabiyev lay on a wool blanket above a bed of straw, and he tried to sleep. He tucked his head into his coat, crossed his arms tightly, and wrapped them around the gear strapped to his chest. His thick beard insulated his cheeks, but the tip of his nose stung; his gloves kept his fingers warm, but a cold draft through the barn blew up his sleeves to his elbows.</p><p>Nabiyev was from the city, from Makhachkala on the shore of the Caspian Sea. He&#x2019;d slept in his share of barns and caves and tents and mud trenches under the open sky, but he had been raised in a concrete apartment block with electricity and water and plumbing and television, and he missed those comforts right now. Still, he kept his complaints to himself. He knew this excursion was necessary. It was part of his job to make the rounds and visit his forces every few months, like it or not.</p><p>At least he wasn&#x2019;t suffering alone. Nabiyev never went <i>anywhere</i> alone. Five members of his security detail were bunked with him in the cold barn. Though it was pitch-black, he could hear their snores and he could smell their bodies and the gun oil from their Kalashnikovs. The other five men who&#x2019;d accompanied him from Makhachkala would be outside on guard, along with half of the local force. Each man awake, his rifle in his lap, a pot of hot tea close by.</p><p>Israpil kept his own rifle within arm&#x2019;s reach, as it was his last line of defense. He carried the AK-74U, a cut-down-barrel variant of the venerable but potent Kalashnikov. As he rolled onto his side to turn away from the draft, he reached out and put a gloved hand on the plastic pistol grip and pulled the weapon closer. He fidgeted for another moment like this, then rolled onto his back. With his boots laced on his feet, his pistol belt around his waist, and his chest harness full of rifle magazines strapped to his upper torso, it was damn hard to get comfortable.</p><p>And it was not just the discomforts of the barn and his gear that kept him awake. No, it was the gnawing constant worry of attack.</p><p>Israpil knew well that he was a prime target of the Russians, because he knew what they were saying about him&#x2014;that <i>he</i> was the future of the resistance. The future of his people. Not just the future of Islamic Dagestan, but the future of an Islamic caliphate in the Caucasus.</p><p>Nabiyev was a top-priority target for Moscow, because he&#x2019;d spent virtually his entire life at war with them. He&#x2019;d been fighting since he was eleven. He&#x2019;d killed his first Russian in Nagorno-Karabakh in 1993 when he was only fifteen, and he&#x2019;d killed many Russians since, in Grozny, and in Tbilisi, and in Tskhinvali, and in Makhachkala.</p><p>Now, not yet thirty-five years old, he served as the military operational commander of the Dagestani Islamic organization Jamaat Shariat, the &#x201c;Islamic Law Community,&#x201d; and he commanded fighters from the Caspian Sea in the east to Chechnya and Georgia and Ossetia in the west, all fighting for the same goal: the expulsion of the invaders and the establishment of Sharia.</p><p>And, <i>inshallah</i>&#x2014;God willing&#x2014;soon Israpil Nabiyev would unite all the organizations of the Caucasus and see his dream fulfilled.</p><p>As the Russians said, he <i>was</i> the future of the resistance.</p><p>And his own people knew this, too, which made his hard life easier. The ten soldiers in his security force, along with thirteen militants of the local Argvani cell&#x2014;each and every one of these men would proudly lay down his life for Israpil.</p><p>He flipped his body around again to shield it from the draft, moving the rifle with him as he tried to find some elusive comfort. He pulled the wool blanket over his shoulder and flicked the straw from his beard that came with it.</p><p><i>Oh, well,</i> he thought to himself. He hoped none of his men would have to lay down his life before daybreak.</p><p>Israpil Nabiyev drifted to sleep in the darkness as a rooster crowed on the hillside just above the village.</p><p><b>T</b>he crowing of the rooster interrupted the transmission of the Russian lying in the weeds a few meters away from the big bird. He waited for a second and a third call from the rooster, and then he put his lips back to the radio attached to his chest harness. &#x201c;Alpha team to overwatch. We have you in sight and will pass your location in one minute.&#x201d;</p><p>There was no verbal response. The sniper overwatch team had been forced to close to within ten meters of the edge of a cinder-block shack in order to get a line of sight on the objective, another one hundred meters on. They would not speak, not even whisper, so near to unfriendlies. The spotter just pressed his transmit button twice, broadcasting a pair of clicks as confirmation that he&#x2019;d received Alpha&#x2019;s message in his earpiece.</p><p>Above the spotter, higher on the steep hillside, eight men heard the two clicks, and then they slowly approached in the black.</p><p>The eight men, along with the two-man sniper team, were troops from Russia&#x2019;s Federal&#x2019;naya Sluzhba Bezopasnosti, their Federal Security Service. Specifically, this team was part of the Alpha Directorate of the FSB&#x2019;s Special Operations Center. The most elite of all Russian Spetsnaz units, the FSB&#x2019;s Alpha Group were experts in counterterror operations, hostage rescue, urban assault, and a vast array of additional deadly arts.</p><p>All the men in this unit were alpinists, as well, though they possessed more mountain training than they needed for this hit. The peaks behind them, toward the north, were much higher than the hills of this valley.</p><p>But it was the other training these men possessed that made them the ideal fit for the mission. Firearms, edged weapons, hand-to-hand, explosives. This Alpha team was composed of hard-core select killers. Silent movers, black operators.</p><p>Through the night the Russians had advanced slowly, all senses on alert despite the hardships their bodies were forced to endure on the journey. The infiltration had been clean; in their six-hour insertion to their objective waypoint they had smelled nothing but forest and had seen nothing but animals: cows sleeping upright or grazing unattended in meadows, foxes darting into and out of the foliage, even large horned ibex high on the rocks of sheer mountain passes.</p><p>Alpha Group were no strangers to Dagestan, but they had more experience operating in nearby Chechnya because, frankly, there were more terrorists to kill in Chechnya than in Dagestan, though Jamaat Shariat seemed to be doing its best to catch up to their Muslim brothers to the west. Chechnya was more mountains and forest, the major conflict zones of Dagestan more urban, but this location, tonight&#x2019;s Omega, or objective, split the difference. Wooded hills of rock all around a tight cluster of dwellings bifurcated by dirt roads, each road sporting a trench down the middle to drain the rainfall lower toward the river.</p><p>The soldiers had dropped their three-day packs a kilometer back, removing from their bodies everything save for tools of war. Now they moved with supreme stealth, low crawling through the pasture just above the village and then bounding in two-man teams through a corral. They passed their sniper team at the edge of the village and began darting between the structures: a feed shed, an outhouse, a single-family dwelling, and then a baked-brick and tin-roofed tractor shed. As they progressed, the men eyed every corner, every road, every black window, with their NODs&#x2014;night observation devices.</p><p>They carried AK-105 rifles, hundreds of rounds of extra 5.45x39-millimeter cartridges in low-profile magazine chest rigs that allowed them to lie flat on the ground to hide from either a sentry&#x2019;s eyes or an enemy&#x2019;s gunfire. Their green tunics and green vests of body armor were smeared with mud and covered with grass stains and wet with melted snow and the sweat of their exertion, even out here in the cold.</p><p>On their belts, holsters held...</p></p><h2>Dissensus: On Politics and Aesthetics</h2><p><p><i>Dissensus: On Politics and Aesthetics </i>brings together some of Jacques Ranci�re's key recent writings on art and politics to show the critical potential of two of his most important concepts: the aesthetics of politics and the politics of aesthetics. </p><p>In this illuminating collection, Ranci�re engages in a radical critique of some of his major contemporaries on questions of art and politics: Gilles Deleuze, Antonio Negri, Giorgio Agamben, Alain Badiou and Jacques Derrida. The essays show how Ranci�re's ideas can be used to analyse contemporary trends in both art and politics, including the events surrounding 9/11, war in the contemporary consensual age, and the ethical turn in aesthetics and politics. Ranci�re elaborates new directions for the concepts of politics and communism, as well as the notion of what a 'politics of art' might be. </p><p>With a brand new introduction from the translator this is a superb collection of the work of one of the world's most influential contemporary thinkers.</p></p><p>A new collection of Jacques Ranci�re&#39;s writings on art and politics with a new introduction for the paperback release<p>Jacques Ranci�re taught at the University of Paris VIII, France, from 1969 to 2000, occupying the Chair of Aesthetics and Politics from 1990 until his retirement. </p><p>Steven Corcoran is a writer and translator living in Berlin.

The unexpurgated edition did not appear in America until 1959, after one of the most spectacular legal battles in publishing history.<br><br>With her soft brown hair, lithe figure and big, wondering eyes, Constance Chatterley is possessed of a certain vitality. Yet she is deeply unhappy; married to an invalid, she is almost as inwardly paralyzed as her husband Clifford is paralyzed below the waist. It is not until she finds refuge in the arms of Mellors the game-keeper, a solitary man of a class apart, that she feels regenerated. Together they move from an outer world of chaos towards an inner world of fulfillment.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Now that we're used to reading about sex, and seeing it in the movies, it's apparent that the novel is memorable for better reasons: namely, that Lawrence was a masterful and lyrical writer, whose story takes us bodily into the world of its characters.The Cambridge edition of Lady Chatterley&#39;s Lover is the first ever to restore to Lawrence&#39;s most famous novel the words that he wrote.

They`re both popular, smart, and gorgeous, but that's where the similarity ends. Elizabeth is friendly, outgoing, and sincere -- nothing like her snobbish and conniving twin. Jessica gets what she wants -- at school, with friends, and especially with boys.<br><br>This time, Jessica has set her sights on Todd Wilkins, the handsome star of the basketball team -- the one boy that Elizabeth really likes. Elizabeth doesn't want to lose him, but what Jessica wants, Jessica usually gets... even if it ends up hurting her sister.<br><br>Meet the Wakefield twins, their guys, and the rest of the gang at Sweet Valley High....</p><p>Chapter<br>1<br>"Okay, when did I get so hideous?" Jessica Wakefield groaned. She leaned in toward her bedroom mirror as her twin sister, Elizabeth, rolled her eyes. "Seriously, Liz, it's like somebody snuck into my room last night and whacked me with the ugly stick."<br>"Yeah. That happened," Elizabeth said, digging through a pile of clothes on Jessica's bed.<br>"I'm totally serious!" Jessica protested. "First of all, I gained, like, five pounds since last week-all in my hips and butt," she said, turning around and craning her neck to see her rear view in the mirror. Her perfect-size-four rear view. "And I hate my hair. I mean, that new shampoo I bought did none of the things it was supposed to do. I'm all split ends and frizz."<br>"Uh-huh," Liz said disinterestedly.<br>"Plus I've got a zit! A huge one! Look at this thing, Liz! It's the zit that ate Sweet Valley!"<br>Jessica got right up in her sister's face.<br>"You're right, Jess," Liz said flatly. "You're completely deformed. You should definitely stay home from school today."<br>Jessica's face crumpled and she collapsed face-first on her unmade bed. "You suck."<br>"What? I'm just agreeing with you."<br>"Fine. Just leave me here to rot. I'm not fit for normal society."<br>Elizabeth laughed and pulled her sister back up, maneuvering her in front of the mirror, where they stood side by side. With their shoulder-length blond hair, blue-green eyes, and perfect California tans, Elizabeth and Jessica were exact duplicates of one another, down to the tiny dimples in their left cheeks when they smiled. Each wore a gold lavaliere around her neck-matching presents from their parents on their sixteenth birthday last June. The only way anyone who didn't know them very well could tell them apart was by the tiny beauty mark on Elizabeth's right shoulder. Those who did know them well knew that Elizabeth's style was more sophisticated and preppy, while Jessica's was up-to-the-minute trendy. Plus Elizabeth always wore a watch, while Jessica did not. Time was never a problem for Jessica. She always felt that things didn't really start until she arrived.<br>"Look at me," Elizabeth said to her twin, who did as she was told. "Now look at you." Jessica did. "If you're hideous, then I'm hideous too. Are you calling me hideous?"<br>Jessica's brow knitted. "You're a freak, you know that?"<br>"Yeah. A freak who can't find her new white sweater," Elizabeth said, returning to her search. "Where did you say you put it?"<br>Jessica hadn't said. Because she'd worn it without asking and spilled marinara sauce down the front, then forgotten to wash it right away. The stain had set, and now the sweater was ruined beyond all hope. She was just opening her mouth to plead ignorance when the phone rang.<br>"I got it!" she cried, grabbing the phone from her bedside table. "Hello?"<br>She took the phone out into the hallway to avoid her sister's growing impatience. Why didn't the girl just give up already and wear something else? Liz could be so stubborn sometimes.<br>"Hey, Liz? Or is this Jessica?" a boy's voice asked.<br>"It's Jessica," she replied. Hmmm. A call from a guy before the first school bell had rung. Her day was looking up already.<br>"Oh, hey, Jess. It's Todd."<br>Todd Wilkins? Even better. Todd was one of the most coveted guys in school. Tall, dark, and yum.<br>"Hey. What's up?" she asked, leaning back against the wall with a smile. Jessica had never really considered Todd before, but hey, if he was calling her, maybe he deserved a spare thought. Or two.<br>"Not much. Is Liz there?" he asked.<br>Instantly, the smile was gone. He was calling for Liz? The star wide receiver of the football team, captain of the basketball team, a shoo-in for best-looking and most popular, was calling for her brainiac sister? What was this, some kind of reality-show prank?<br>&nbsp;"Actually, she's kind of busy right now," Jessica said, taking a few steps away from her bedroom. "Spell-checking her latest marathon paper, of course. Such a nerd. So, how's the team? I saw that insane catch you made at practice the other day. ESPN highlight reel all the way."<br>Get him talking about himself, Jessica thought. Guys love that.<br>"You saw that?" The blush was evident in Todd's voice. Jessica glowed with triumph.<br>"Are you kidding? I practically missed my dismount because of it," Jessica told him. "Didn't you hear me cheering? I stopped practice and everything." It also couldn't hurt to remind him that she was captain of the cheerleading squad that went all out to support him every week.<br>"Thanks. That's . . . uh . . . thanks," Todd stammered.<br>"Can't wait for the first game," Jessica said happily. She just loved to make guys nervous. "I bet you'll have college scouts coming out for you in no time."<br>"I don't know about that, but thanks," Todd said humbly.<br>Jessica smiled. Sometimes she was so good she could hardly believe it herself. Two seconds of flattery and the guy had forgotten all about Liz. Boys were so predictable.<br>"Anyway, do you think you could see if Liz is free yet?" he asked.<br>Jessica frowned. Okay, maybe not totally predictable. "Oh, you know what? She just got in the shower."<br>"I could wait," Todd said hopefully.<br>Jessica forced a laugh. "Are you kidding? She'll be <br>in there forever. Liz takes the longest showers." Big <br>lie. Jessica was actually the hot-water hog of the family. In fact, Elizabeth usually had to take short showers because the hot water stopped half a minute in, thanks to Jessica.<br>Todd took a deep breath. "All right, then. I guess I'll just . . . talk to her later. Could you tell her I called?"<br>"No problem!" Jessica said. "See you in school!"<br>"Yeah. See ya."<br>Jessica hung up the phone and rolled her eyes. Todd Wilkins calling for Liz? What a joke. Elizabeth probably didn't even know Todd existed. She was way too serious for a gorgeous athlete like him.<br>"Who was that?" Elizabeth asked when Jessica traipsed back into her room. She had two neatly folded piles of Jessica's clothes in front of her now-clothes that had been strewn all over the room five minutes ago.<br>"Todd Wilkins," Jessica replied, tossing the phone onto her bed. "I don't know why he didn't call my cell. I'm sure he has the number."<br>Elizabeth paused midfold. "Todd called you?"<br>"Yeah. Guess he just couldn't wait another half hour to talk to me in school," Jessica said with a shrug, turning toward her reflection again.<br>"Oh." Elizabeth attacked another mountain of clothes, tearing through them like a tornado.<br>"Liz? What's wrong?" Jessica asked, staring at her sister in the mirror. She was whipping clothes at the bed as if they'd somehow offended her.<br>"What's wrong is I wish you'd stop taking my stuff without asking," Elizabeth blurted out.<br>Jessica rolled her eyes as she turned around. "So borrow something of mine if you want. I have white sweaters too, you know."<br>"That's not the point," Elizabeth said, irritated.<br>"Then what is the point?" Jessica asked.<br>"The point is . . . ," Elizabeth said, looking around at the mess. "The point is . . ." Finally, her shoulders slumped. She took a deep breath and sighed. "Just forget it. I'll wear something else."<br>She turned and walked out of Jessica's room, stepping over a pile of stuff on the way out the door. Jessica shook her head at her sister's back as she went. Liz really was way too possessive of her things.<br>Todd Wilkins. Huh, Jessica thought. We would look pretty hot together.<br>With one last fluff of her hair and a quick, appreciative glance at her reflection-hideousness forgotten-Jessica grabbed her books and headed downstairs for breakfast. There was nothing that put her in a good mood faster than the thought of a brand-new conquest.</p><h2>Broken Vessels: Essays (Culture; 26; Garland Reference)</h2><p>Written between 1977 and 1990, universally acclaimed when they appeared in Godine hardcover, and exploring subjects close to home and close to the bone, these twenty-two diverse essays reveal the spiritual strength and shrewdly lyrical prose for which Andre Dubus has been recognized worldwide.<br><br>Personal but never indulgent, sensitive but never maudlin, these forays into Dubus's past and present conjure up small worlds: a Catholic boyhood in Cajun Louisiana, the transcendental quality of baseball, the luck and slipperiness of life, the precarious business of making a living by writing. These worlds are presented in a voice that is as powerful as it is poignant, that never flinches from the stark realities that have so colored Dubus's recent past and personal life. Especially moving are his descriptions of his children, his wrenching account of the 1986 automobile accident that cost him his leg, and of the ensuing struggle for his spiritual and physical survival.<br><br>Broken Vessels is a book that, in its scope and sympathy, its grace and courage, never fails to startle with the sudden impact of quiet truths, passionately felt and powerfully expressed.</p><p><i>Broken Vessels</i>, Andre Dubus's first collection of essays, was written between 1977 and 1990. During this period, Dubus hit his peak as an essayist, survived an accident that almost destroyed his will to write, and went on to regain and exceed his earlier power as a writer. Reading this book is almost as rich an experience as meeting a fascinating person: you'll learn the best way to scramble eggs, why baseball is a transcendental experience, the risks and rewards of idealistic poverty, and what it's like to see ghosts. Dubus writes as a Catholic, and most of his essays speak explicitly of the sacramental nature of his everyday experiences. Particularly effective are the essays describing Dubus's struggle to recover from a traffic accident that occurred after he stopped to help stranded motorists on a roadside in 1986. "Lights of the Long Night" is among the best of these, containing the kind of writing that makes you close the book immediately, knowing you've seen so deeply into a person's soul that you have to sit with what you've learned and wait for some sense of how to respond before you're entitled to keep turning the pages. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>In his first volume of nonfiction, short-story writer Dubus (The Last Worthless Thing, 1986, etc.) reveals the passions, struggles, and strengths underlying his art, life, and arduous recovery from personal tragedy. Sparing few of life's messy details and contradictions, these 22 deeply personal essays, dating from 1977 to 1990 and strongly reminiscent of the author's fictional themes, offer an unflinching view of one man's search for truth. In ``Of Robin Hood and Womanhood,'' a childhood tendency toward ``angelic devotion to the female'' yields slowly to an effort ``to see women as they are...creatures like me.'' ``On Charon's Wharf'' connects the mysteries of the Eucharist--``without touch, God is a monologue...he must touch and be touched''--to the dissolution of a marriage once words suffocate action. Here are the joys of writing and the frustrations of publishing (in five essays that move from childhood storytelling to a tribute to writer Richard Yates); the search for social justice (``The Judge and Other Snakes''); the pleasures and responsibilities of fatherhood (throughout). Here also are moments of shimmering lyricism, as in ``Under the Lights,'' when a rare home-run ball hit by a Class C journeyman appears as ``a bright and vanishing sphere of human possibility, soaring into the darkness beyond our vision.'' The last third of the book, a wrenching chronicle of loss and reaffirmation, deals with the highway accident that cost Dubus the use of his legs, the subsequent breakup of his third marriage, and the ensuing battle for physical and spiritual peace. We are left with a view of life as an overlapping sequence of stories, answering a ``need to speak into the silence of mortality,'' informed by the quest for connection, the ``sacrament'' of ``shared ritual'' so ably served by this collection.

In a brilliant and daring move, House targeted $68 million in taxes on seized rebel cotton (over $1.2 billion in 2005 dollars) and demanded it as repayment for centuries of unpaid labor.<br><br>Dr. Berry tells how the Justice Department, persuaded by the postmaster general, banned the activities of Callie House&#x2019;s town organizers, violated her constitutional rights to assembly and to petition Congress, and falsely accused her of mail fraud; the federal officials had the post office open the mail of almost all African-Americans, denying delivery on the smallest pretext. Berry shows how African-American newspapers, most of which preached meekness toward whites, systematically ignored or derided Mrs. House&#x2019;s movement, which was essentially a poor person&#x2019;s movement. Despite being denied mail service and support from the African-American establishment of the day, Mrs. House&#x2019;s Ex-Slave Association flourished until she was imprisoned by the Justice Department for violating the postal laws of the United States; suddenly deprived of her spirit, leadership and ferocity, the first national grassroots African-American movement fell apart.<br><br>Callie House, so long forgotten that her grave has been lost, emerges as a courageous pioneering activist, a forerunner of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. My Face Is Black Is True is a fascinating book of original scholarship that reclaims a magnificent heroine.</p><p>Mary Frances Berry was born in Nashville, Tennessee. She received a bachelor&#x2019;s and master&#x2019;s degree at Howard University, a doctorate in history from the University of Michigan, and a juris doctor degree from the University of Michigan Law School. <br><br>Dr. Berry has received many awards for her public service and scholarly activities, among them the NAACP&#x2019;s Roy Wilkins Award and Image Award, the Rosa Parks Award of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and the Ebony Magazine Black Achievement Award. <br><br>In addition to having been the chairperson of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission for eleven years, Dr. Berry is the Geraldine R. Segal Professor of American Social Thought at the University of Pennsylvania, where she teaches history of American law. She lives in Washington, D.C.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><b>Prologue</b><br><br>When I was twelve, I became an outlaw, a transgressor of racial boundaries. That summer I did the ironing while taking care of the Abbotts&#x2019; infant boy. They lived in an all-white well-off Nashville neighborhood founded as a streetcar suburb in the late nineteenth century. On a July afternoon when Mrs. Abbott came home, I showed her a phonograph record I had taken from the shelf and played while I worked. Excitedly, I told her how I just loved the music, but the more I talked, the more agitated she became. Suddenly she snatched the record from my hands and practically exploded. &#x201c;You had no business touching those records, and you shouldn&#x2019;t be listening to such music in the first place.&#x201d; I told her I was sorry, but she still seemed angry. I knew I had misbehaved terribly, but I did not understand how or why listening to that music was wrong.<br><br>I did not tell my mother, but when I finally told my Aunt Serriner, she worried aloud that I might become labeled a troublemaker. &#x201c;Gal,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;don&#x2019;t be getting out of your place, stay out of those white folks&#x2019; things.&#x201d; I stayed out of &#x201c;white folks&#x2019; things&#x201d; thereafter, or at least kept silent when I did not. However, the episode forever clouded my pleasure upon discovering Beethoven and his Symphony Number Nine.<br><br>Callie House did not stay out of &#x201c;white folks&#x2019; things&#x201d; either. She was also a racial outlaw. An African-American laundress from Tennessee, she became the leader of a turn-of-the-twentieth-century poor people&#x2019;s movement that sought pensions from the federal government as compensation for slavery. Her movement, federal officials concluded, &#x201c;is setting the negroes wild.&#x201d; They thought that if they did not stop her, when African Americans understood that the government would never grant pensions, the nation would &#x201c;have some very serious questions to settle in connection with the control of the race.&#x201d; Consequently, the government harassed Callie House for exercising her constitutional right to petition the government and to mobilize others in the cause. When she would not relent, calling her &#x201c;defiant,&#x201d; the Post Office Department and the Pension Bureau redoubled their efforts to smear and confine her. Her organization was the first mass reparations movement led by African Americans.1<br><br>Callie House and the ex-slave movement did not accept the preachments or adopt the meek attitudes that Booker T. Washington counseled at the time. Today, some people argue against reparations because those who experienced slavery are no longer among the living. It is worth remembering that thousands of ex-slaves devoted years to pressing the reparations cause. They organized support networks and helped one another through very difficult times. That they bore the marks of bondage, as living ex-slaves, did not help them. Whites and elite African Americans ridiculed their pleas for redress, and the government disrespected their claims.<br><br>The first homes I knew, the orphanage on Laurel Street and the house of my mother&#x2019;s eldest sister, Aunt Everleaner, where I lived in the 1940s, lay a few streets away from where Callie House resided until her death in 1928. There in South Nashville, down in the valley, looking up to the state capitol on the hill, we both became troublemakers. Commercial development has, for the most part, overtaken the neighborhood, erasing every vestige, every physical structure of that time and place. The address at which Callie House lived has long been occupied by a public housing unit. This book tells her story.<br><b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><b>We Need a Movement</b><br><br><i>We are organizing ourselves together as a race of people who feels that they have been wronged.</i><br><br>Callie House<br>(1899)<br><br>Callie House knew hard work. Born a slave, now a washerwoman and a widow with five children, she was at the bottom of America&#x2019;s social and economic ladder as she stood proudly before a cheering crowd of African Americans. The National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty and Pension Association had just elected her its first and only female officer. Addressing the convention delegates who had honored her with their votes, she talked about the thousands of people she had met on the road in the cause of compensation for slave service. House spoke of organizing local branches and collecting petitions to submit to Congress. She told them of her long hours spent &#x201c;among strangers laboring to the best of my ability for the rights which my race is justly entitled to.&#x201d; This woman of modest means but great courage would soon become the association&#x2019;s leader. For her work, she would be praised by poor African Americans, ridiculed by the race&#x2019;s elites, and targeted by high government officials, who feared her influence with the masses, and eventually land in jail. But on this November day in 1898, as she stood before supporters, newly elected assistant secretary of the nation&#x2019;s largest reparations movement, all things seemed possible.1<br><br>Callie House came to prominence in the period historian Rayford Logan labeled the nadir, the lowest point along the long, rough road African Americans had traveled since Emancipation. Women were legally barred from voting, and black men suffered disenfranchisement through subterfuge and violence. Booker T. Washington advised against political activism. But many like Mrs. House chose another course. By the early twentieth century, her organization, the National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty and Pension Association, according to federal officials, would swell to about 300,000, determined black people petitioning a government that barely recognized their existence and demanding a law ordering reparations for slavery.2<br><br>Through cajoling and explaining, House inspired the old ex-slaves to exercise their rights as citizens to demand repayment for their long suffering. She urged them not to give up despite continued oppression and listened as they shared stories about their lives under slavery. Often in tears, aging and ailing men and women recalled being treated as less than human during their years of unpaid labor for masters who sexually abused slave women, broke families apart, and who had &#x201c;the power to whip them to death.&#x201d;3<br><br>Although steeled for the effort to gain reparations, House and her cohorts were living in desperate times and still reeling from a bleak, awful past. House&#x2019;s life experiences made her intimately familiar with the plight of those she referred to as the &#x201c;ignorant, bare footed and naked&#x201d; among her fellow ex-slaves. From family accounts, she was born into slavery in Rutherford County near Nashville, Tennessee, in 1861. (Her birth, like that of other slaves, was not officially recorded.) There, in a landscape of rolling hills, cereal and tobacco production, and horse farming, slave owners depended upon the labor of the approximately 13,000 blacks who constituted about 50 percent of the total population of the county.<br><br>Whether slaves had masters who, as one Tennessee slave put it, &#x201c;gave them rations and warm clothes to wear&#x201d; or scraps and rags that did not cover their nakedness, their lives in bondage etched indelible memories of suffering and abuse. A collective consciousness born of brutal experience shaped the reactions of Callie&#x2019;s family and other slaves when freedom finally came. One Tennessee ex-slave remembered that on the plantation where she lived they could go to church, where they were admonished to obey their masters. She went to services &#x201c;barefoot with a rag tied around her head and a dress that came up to her knees,&#x201d; which was all she had to wear. She also was &#x201c;whipped with a bull whip&#x201d; and was not ashamed to say, in old age, that she &#x201c;still had scars on her back put there by the master.&#x201d; Another Tennessee ex-slave told of being sold away from her husband, whom she had never seen again. At the slave yard they told her to take off her clothes and roll down the hill so the prospective buyers &#x201c;could see you had no bones broken or sores on you.&#x201d;<br><br>The coming of the Civil War finally brought freedom but not an immediate response to the suffering. In 1862 and early 1863, when Callie House was a toddler, the Union Army swept through Tennessee, which had joined the Confederacy. In their wake the slaves made a mass move toward freedom. Her family was among the thousands of so-called contraband&#x2014;slaves who either ran away or whose masters fled at the Union approach&#x2014;in their wake. When the Union soldiers, whom the children called &#x201c;the Blue Men,&#x201d; came, slave men, women, and children followed along behind them. The women did laundry and cooking for the soldiers; the army gathered up the black men to work as laborers, digging ditches and building fortifications. Refugees slept where they could and ate what they could find. Then the Union decided to recruit blacks as soldiers. Callie House&#x2019;s father, Tom Guy, like many other freed men, probably joined the Union Army in the 29th U.S. Colored Infantry Regiment. The unit served in the area at the Battle of Stones River at the end of 1862 and the beginning of 1863. In heavy fighting that the Union won, more than a third of the Union and Confederate troops were killed, wounded, or captured. In November and early December 1864, the 29th Regiment also helped repel the Confederate drive into Tennessee, ending at Franklin just south of Nashville. The fighting and the federal occupation devastated farms and communities in much of the surround-ing area, including Rutherford County. The numbers of refugees&#x2014;contraband&#x2014;fleeing slavery increased to a torrent.<br><br>House&#x2019;s family and other African Americans tried to gain and maintain their freedom without being demoralized by the uncertainty all around them.

Vaelin Al Sorna stared at the fletching as it vibrated before his eyes, feeling a sting on his nose and a trickle of blood left by the shaft&#x2019;s barbed head. He hadn&#x2019;t heard the archer who loosed the arrow, nor had he heard the betraying creak of string and stave.</p><p>To an onlooker his reaction would have seemed swift and immediate, rolling to the right, coming to his knees, bow drawn and arrow loosed in a single smooth movement. But he knew it to be slow, even as he saw the archer, running now with his horn raised to his lips, take the shaft directly in the back and fall dead. Slow.</p><p>There was a soft rustle at his side as Ellese appeared out of the surrounding carpet of ferns, notched bow in hand. &#x201c;The camp, Uncle,&#x201d; she said, slightly breathless with eagerness as she started to rise. &#x201c;We need to move quickly&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Her words died as Vaelin reached out to clamp a hand over her mouth, exerting enough force to keep her crouching. He held her there until the next arrow came, arcing down from the forest canopy to sink into the earth half a dozen feet away. A searching arrow, Master Hutril would have called it. Always useful when flushing prey. But not today.</p><p>Vaelin met Ellese&#x2019;s dark, glaring eyes and raised his own to the treetops before removing his hand. He won&#x2019;t blow his horn just yet, he told her, hands moving in the sign language so laboriously taught to her over the preceding months. That would reveal his position. I&#x2019;ll run to the right. He turned, tensing in anticipation of a sprint, then paused to add, Don&#x2019;t miss.</p><p>He surged to his feet, boots pounding on the forest floor as he ran, describing a winding course through the trees. This time he heard the bowstring&#x2019;s thrum and threw himself behind the broad trunk of an ancient yew, glimpsing an explosion of splintered bark in the corner of his eye. A second later came the sound of another bowstring, the note deeper, possessed of an almost musical precision that bespoke the power of the weapon and the skill of its wielder. A brief pause, then the thud of a body falling from a tall height to the forest floor.</p><p>Vaelin remained crouched behind the yew, eyes closed as his ears drank in the song of the forest. It wasn&#x2019;t long before the chitter of birds, stilled by the unwelcome intrusion, began to return and the wind carried no more trace of sweating, fearful men.</p><p>He emerged from his refuge to find Ellese busily searching the body of the outlaw her arrow had plucked from the treetops. Her movements were swift and practised, hands betraying no sign of a tremble despite having just wrested the life from a man. He knew she had killed before in Cumbrael, during a brief and quickly crushed resurgence of the ever-troublesome Sons of the Trueblade. It doesn&#x2019;t vex her at all, Reva had written in the letter she sent north along with her adopted daughter. Which vexes me greatly.</p><p>He saw scant resemblance to Reva in this girl, hardly surprising given the fact that they shared no blood. Her hair was black and her eyes dark, and she was perhaps an inch shorter, if a little thicker of limb. However, the apparent immunity to the effects of killing was a recognisably familial trait she had clearly picked up somewhere along the road. One she shared with the man she called uncle.</p><p>&#x201c;Bluestone,&#x201d; she said, tossing aside the dead man&#x2019;s purse and holding up a handful of gleaming azure pebbles. &#x201c;Wrapped in cotton so they wouldn&#x2019;t clink.&#x201d; She angled her head as she surveyed the outlaw&#x2019;s corpse. &#x201c;Knew his business, at least.&#x201d; She glanced up at Vaelin before adding with a grin, &#x201c;Not well enough, though.&#x201d;</p><p>Vaelin crouched to retrieve the man&#x2019;s bow, a flat-staved hunting weapon typical to all fiefs of the Realm, except Cumbrael. Had the fellow possessed a longbow and the skill to use it, Vaelin knew he would likely be dead now.</p><p>&#x201c;Check his scalp,&#x201d; he told Ellese, who duly whipped away the man&#x2019;s woollen cap, revealing a shaven head. Vaelin used his boot to turn the corpse&#x2019;s head until he found it, a crude tattoo forming a dark crimson stain amidst the grey stubble. &#x201c;The Bloody Sparrows,&#x201d; he said, moving away.</p><p>The outlaw he had killed lay some twenty paces off, facedown with Vaelin&#x2019;s arrow protruding from his back at a near-vertical angle. Vaelin worked the shaft loose, grunting with the effort of extracting the barbed head from the bony trap of the man&#x2019;s spine, before turning him over.</p><p>&#x201c;Jumin Vek,&#x201d; he said after a brief survey of the blotchy, pockmarked face.</p><p>&#x201c;You know him?&#x201d; Ellese asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I should. I arrested him up on a Queen&#x2019;s Warrant four years ago. He left a trail of murder, rape and thievery all along the roads of Renfael before fetching up in the Reaches. I packed him off on a ship to face the noose in Frostport.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Seems he managed an escape.&#x201d;</p><p>Or bribed his way clear, Vaelin thought. It was an all-too-common occurrence these days. With so much money to be made stealing and smuggling the bounty of the Northern Reaches, it seemed as if every outlaw had the means to buy their way out of trouble. As Tower Lord, and therefore the queen&#x2019;s appointed warden of this land, the frequency with which Vaelin was obliged to recapture the dregs of the Realm made him less than scrupulous in observing her royal edict against immediate execution.</p><p>&#x201c;Another Bloody Sparrow?&#x201d; Ellese asked.</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Vaelin tossed away Jumin Vek&#x2019;s cap to reveal a shock of thick, greasy hair. He grasped the man&#x2019;s chin and turned it, revealing a more accomplished image inked into the sallow flesh of his neck. &#x201c;The Damned Rats. They&#x2019;re mostly disgraced former Realm Guard.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So we face two gangs today?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I doubt it. Lord Orven wiped out most of the Bloody Sparrows last winter. It seems the Rats found room for some survivors.&#x201d;</p><p>He relieved the unfortunate Jumin Vek of his purse, finding it to contain two nuggets of gold along with a few bluestones.</p><p>&#x201c;Your nose is bleeding, Uncle,&#x201d; Ellese observed as he rose.</p><p>Vaelin took a rag from his belt, soaked it with a small bottle of corr tree oil and pressed it to the cut on his nose. He swallowed a grunt of pain as the concoction seeped its fiery way into the wound, unable to suppress the sense that it hadn&#x2019;t stung quite so much in his youth.</p><p>&#x201c;Fetch the others,&#x201d; he told Ellese, dousing his face with water from his canteen to wash away the residual blood. &#x201c;Meet me at the canyon&#x2019;s edge. And, Ellese,&#x201d; he added as she turned away. &#x201c;The bluestones.&#x201d;</p><p>He held out his hand, meeting her gaze until she gave a huff of annoyance and handed over the stones, griping in a low mutter, &#x201c;You have me hunting scum for no pay.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your mother sent you to me for an education. If you want paid work, there&#x2019;s plenty to be had in the North Guard, or the mines. Until sold, under law bluestone and gold belong to the queen. You know that.&#x201d; He pocketed the stones and jerked his head in dismissal. &#x201c;On your way.&#x201d;</p><p>It transpired that the outlaw camp was in fact a stockade formed of a semicircular enclosure arcing out from the eastern wall of a canyon known as Ultin&#x2019;s Gulch. The place had been named in honour of the Reaches&#x2019; most famed miner, a man Vaelin remembered fondly from the Liberation War.</p><p>Ever a cheerful soul, Ultin had returned to the Reaches bearing the queen&#x2019;s order to scrape all the wealth he could from the mines, thereby filling the royal coffers to meet the escalating costs of war. Honoured for his efforts as a Sword of the Realm with a generous accompanying pension, Ultin had politely refused Vaelin&#x2019;s offer of a position as Lord Overseer of Mineworks. Instead, he retired to a smallholding near North Tower where, over the course of the next three years, he proceeded to drink himself to death. It was the war, my lord, his widow had told Vaelin the day they gave her husband&#x2019;s body to the fire. All those murdered souls, murdered children. The men he lost at Alltor&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all of it. He could never get it out of his head.</p><p>Vaelin spared a brief thought for Ultin&#x2019;s memory before focusing his attention on the stockade. It was plainly new built, the timbers forming its defensive wall still green and unseasoned, although they seemed solid enough. The occupants had constructed a lookout post atop the canyon wall, providing a no doubt fine view of the surrounding landscape. Vaelin knew the ground to the east consisted of a half-mile-long expanse of bare rock, across which no attacking force could expect to approach undetected.</p><p>The canyon floor was similarly lacking in cover but also narrower, allowing for a rapid assault. Even so, he didn&#x2019;t relish the prospect and found this new tactic of fortification troubling. Usually, the various outlaw and smuggling gangs would establish temporary camps deep in the forest or the more inaccessible crags from which they would raid the caravan routes. Now it appeared this particular group had opted for a permanent home. Are they getting bolder? he wondered. Or just more desperate.</p><p>He detected only the smallest sign of the Cumbraelin&#x2019;s approach, just a faint scrape of buckskin on grass before the man appeared at his side, lying flat as Vaelin did.</p><p>&#x201c;My lord,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Master Tallspear.&#x201d; Vaelin glanced behind to see the war party of Bear People emerge from the forest at a crawl, spears and bows held low so as not to break the silhouette of the skyline.</p><p>&#x201c;You can see it&#x2019;s as we said,&#x201d; Tallspear said, nodding at the outlaws&#x2019; stockade. Over the course of recent years Vaelin had often pondered the fact that Tallspear&#x2019;s face possessed only the most meagre vestige of the man who had once tried very hard to kill him. The Cumbraelin&#x2019;s features were still the hardened, weathered mask of a lifelong hunter, but the fiery glint of fanaticism had long since faded from his gaze. Apart from the longbow he carried, his garb was that of the Bear People and he spoke their language, still beyond Vaelin&#x2019;s skills to master, with an easy fluency. Although Vaelin still couldn&#x2019;t help thinking of him as Cumbraelin, in any way that mattered he was now a hunter of the Bear People clan, evidenced by the name they had given him. Vaelin knew he would probably never learn the man&#x2019;s birth name, and found himself content in his ignorance.</p><p>&#x201c;You said you found this a month ago?&#x201d; Vaelin asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Twenty-five days, to be precise. It wasn&#x2019;t here two weeks before. Our people come here fairly regularly, plenty of beavers to be trapped in the river.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So they saw you?&#x201d;</p><p>Tallspear responded with a frown that was both amused and faintly insulted.</p><p>&#x201c;Apologies.&#x201d; Vaelin turned his gaze back to the stockade. &#x201c;How often do they raid?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the curious thing, my lord. They don&#x2019;t, as far as we can tell. Very few tracks in the surrounding country, except what you&#x2019;d expect from the occasional hunting party. For the most part they just stay in there. Truth be told, we were tempted to leave them be, but the elders felt we should honour our treaty with the Tower Man.&#x201d;</p><p>Vaelin inclined his head in thanks. Since being granted leave to settle in the Reaches after their forced migration from the icy wastes to the north, the Bear People had consistently proven themselves loyal if insular subjects of the Realm. &#x201c;Be sure to tell them their consideration is appreciated.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I will, my lord. Also, two-thirds of the spoils when we&#x2019;re done would also greatly emphasise the honour in which you hold the Bear People.&#x201d;</p><p>Vaelin bit down a sigh. After being spared execution and finding a home with the Bear People, Tallspear had forsaken the god-worshipping fanaticism that had brought him to this land intent on assassinating its Tower Lord. Instead, these days the Cumbraelin&#x2019;s reserves of zeal were now fully employed in the role of chief bargainer for his adopted tribe, keen to protect them from the greed of the Realm-born.</p><p>&#x201c;Half,&#x201d; Vaelin said. &#x201c;Including profits from the sale of any gold and bluestone we recover.&#x201d;</p><p>The hunter seemed about to argue the point but fell silent at a loud click from behind. Vaelin turned to see a diminutive young woman crouched nearby, a small black bear at her side. The woman&#x2019;s name was Iron Eyes, and it was easy to see where she got it in the scowl she directed at Tallspear. As the only shaman remaining to the Bear People, she was the closest thing they had to an overall leader. She was also Tallspear&#x2019;s wife and mother to their three children.</p><p>She clicked her tongue again before telling her husband, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be rude,&#x201d; in clipped but well-spoken Realm Tongue. &#x201c;Half is acceptable, Tower Man,&#x201d; she added, turning to Vaelin. &#x201c;But there must be a blood price for any hunters called to join the Green Fire.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; Vaelin inclined his head before returning his attention to the stockade. He counted a dozen sentries on the wall, each bearing either bow or crossbow. Once they realised an attack was under way more would surely join them, meaning a charge across the floor of the gulch would inevitably cost lives. In addition to the forty or so Bear People, he also had another sixty North Guard, surely enough to put the matter beyond doubt regardless of how many arrows the outlaws cast their way.</p><p>&#x201c;Best wait for darkness, my lord,&#x201d; Tallspear said, evidently following his line of thought. &#x201c;We can easily get within fifty paces of that wall come midnight, put up a volley to cover a charge for the gate. A few blows from a decent-sized ram should be enough to gain entry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll be expecting their scouts to return come nightfall,&#x201d; Vaelin said, shaking his head. &#x201c;Waiting for midnight will take too long.&#x201d; He thought a moment longer before nodding at the small bear at Iron Eyes&#x2019; side. &#x201c;Does he have a name?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Little Teeth,&#x201d; Iron Eyes replied, running a hand through the beast&#x2019;s thick fur. He let out a contented huff and nuzzled her side in return.</p><p>&#x201c;Wise Bear&#x2019;s beast was called Iron Claw,&#x201d; Vaelin recalled. &#x201c;He carried him all the way across the ice to the land of the Dark Hearts. There we fought a great battle. You know this?&#x201d;</p><p>Iron Eyes scowled again, nodding cautiously. The old shaman had never returned from the ice and neither the Bear People nor anyone else had discovered his fate. Vaelin knew they still hoped for his return and that his continued failure to do so was a decidedly sore point. &#x201c;I know this,&#x201d; the shaman said.</p><p>&#x201c;Iron Claw was brave,&#x201d; Vaelin told her. &#x201c;How brave is Little Teeth?&#x201d;</p><p>They set out the moment the sun dipped behind the eastern peaks. Vaelin, in company with Tallspear, Iron Eyes, Ellese and a dozen North Guard, made a silent descent into the gulch. They forded the narrow but swift flowing river running through the centre of the canyon and crawled the remaining few hundred paces to a shallow depression within bowshot of the stockade. Once halted, Vaelin nodded to Iron Eyes. The shaman briefly ran a hand over Little Teeth&#x2019;s snout before fixing her gaze upon his. After a short pause both bear and shaman blinked in unison before the animal loped away into the gloom, making for the south-facing stretch of the stockade wall.</p><p>&#x201c;What now, Uncle?&#x201d; Ellese asked in a whisper that drew a sharp glance from Vaelin.</p><p>Use your ha...</p></p><h2>The Belgariad Set, Books 1-5: Pawn of Prophecy, Queen of Sorcery, Magician's Gambit, Castle of Wizardry, &amp; Enchanter's End Game</h2><p>Set of FIVE mass market paperbacks</p><p></p><h2>The Compassionate Congregation: A Handbook for People Who Care</h2><p>This valuable handbook for elders, deacons, pastors, and other caregivers offers first-hand stories, practical advice, and resources to help churches care for people in a wide range of difficult situations.

Her first work of detective fiction was a serialized story published by the Daily Express in 1927. Entitled The White Cottage Mystery, it contained atypical themes for a woman writer of the era. Her breakthrough occurred in 1929 with the publication of The Crime at Black Dudley. This introduced Albert Campion, albeit originally as a minor character. He returned in Mystery Mile, thanks in part to pressure from her American publishers, much taken with the character. Campion proved so successful that Allingham made him the centrepiece of another 17 novels and over 20 short stories, continuing into the 1960s.</p><h2>Wolf Pack</h2><p><b>Finalists for the 2005 Aurora Award &#x2013; Best Long-Form Work in English category.</b><br><br>After a devastating forest fire, a ranger discovers a litter of wolf cubs.

Matthews examines ancient Israel�&#x2019;s prophets chronologically, providing sketches of their historical contexts. He explains pertinent aspects of historical geography, economic conditions, and social forces that influence a prophet�&#x2019;s life and message. This analysis includes many of the images and metaphors a prophet used to communicate effectively. Thus, for example, the reader only skims the surface of a text without understanding what it meant to be a member of Tekoa�&#x2019;s community of hill country farmers and herders, or what an exiled Levite from Anathoth experienced as a prophet in Jerusalem.</p><p>This substantially revised and expanded second edition meets the needs of both beginning and advanced students.<br><br>"This is a user-friendly, insightful introduction to the prophets and their times. It brings together for readers the prophetic books, the figures they represent, and the world that produced them."<br>--<b>Andrew Dearman</b>, Fuller Theological Seminary<br><br>"The sheer genius of Victor Matthews is his ability to take very dense material and present it in a way that is thoroughly engaging, well researched, and brilliantly written. This study packs a lot of punch in a short amount of space and welcomes both students and scholars alike into the rich world of the ancient Near Eastern prophetic tradition and each of Israel's prophets. This text is an excellent resource, an indispensable tool for learning, and should be used in every biblical course on the prophets."<br>--<b>Carol J. Dempsey</b>, University of Portland<br><br>"<i>The Hebrew Prophets and Their Social World</i> suits the needs of the college and seminary classroom in exemplary fashion. In it, Matthews sets the biblical prophets in their broader social context and in their specific historical contexts. He describes the phenomenon of prophecy, traces the outlines of its developments in ancient Israel from Moses to Malachi, and sketches the key themes in the preaching of each of the classical prophets. Supplemented by inserts that examine important background issues and a very helpful glossary and couched in readable, direct prose, this introduction sets a high standard."<br>--<b>Mark Biddle</b>, Baptist Theological Seminary at Richmond<br><br>"Victor Matthews has produced a very readable volume that provides the information students and other readers of the Old Testament need to begin a fruitful journey with the prophets. He has put the prophetic books in the full context of the Hebrew Bible and in the process helped his readers understand a number of issues in biblical interpretation.

Padden and Humphries employ the capitalized "Deaf" to refer to deaf people who share a natural language--American Sign Language (ASL)--and a complex culture, historically created and actively transmitted across generations. </p><p> Signed languages have traditionally been considered to be simply sets of gestures rather than natural languages. This mistaken belief, fostered by hearing people's cultural views, has had tragic consequences for the education of deaf children; generations of children have attended schools in which they were forbidden to use a signed language. For Deaf people, as Padden and Humphries make clear, their signed language is life-giving, and is at the center of a rich cultural heritage. </p><p> The tension between Deaf people's views of themselves and the way the hearing world views them finds its way into their stories, which include tales about their origins and the characteristics they consider necessary for their existence and survival. <i>Deaf in America</i> includes folktales, accounts of old home movies, jokes, reminiscences, and translations of signed poems and modern signed performances. The authors introduce new material that has never before been published and also offer translations that capture as closely as possible the richness of the original material in ASL. </p><p> <i>Deaf in America</i> will be of great interest to those interested in culture and language as well as to Deaf people and those who work with deaf children and Deaf people. </p></p><p><b>Carol Padden</b> is a Professor in the Department of Communication at the University of California, San Diego.A fascinating glimpse into a world unfamiliar to most of us. (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>To be deaf, it seems obvious, must be to live in a world of silence. That, say the authors of <i>Deaf in America</i>, is where most people get it wrong...[Padden and Humphries] challenge their readers to imagine a world, one with a "different center"--one in which ability or inability to hear is not at the core. The thing that links it all together is sign language, which Deaf in America contemplates, illustrates, and celebrates.<br> --Paul Berg (<i>Washington Post</i>)<br><br>A long, painful experience of hearing intolerance has generally kept Deaf culture fairly closed to outsiders, even sympathetic ones. But now Padden and Humphries...have written a charming small book that invites the rest of us at least part way in...A most welcome addition to that very small shelf of books that truly illuminate the experience of being deaf.<br> --Beryl Lieff Benderly (<i>Psychology Today</i>)<br><br>Through the use of folklore, apocryphal stories, poetry, jokes, and discussion of split factions and advocacy organizations, Padden and Humphries gracefully explain how deaf culture works, what it means to its members, how they define themselves within it, and how they interact with the world outside. Providing rare insight into this universe of silence, this volume conveys the joy and satisfaction that many deaf people have in their lives and shows that being deaf is not a handicap that most hearing people think. (<i>Booklist</i>)</p><h2>The Crime of Sheila Mcgough</h2><p>In the winter of 1996, Janet Malcolm received a letter from a stranger--a disbarred lawyer named Sheila McGough, who had recently been released from prison, and who wrote that she had been convicted of crimes she had not committed. Malcolm decided to look into the case, and this book--a dazzling work <br>of journalism as well as a searching meditation on character, on the law, and on the incompatibility of narrative with truth--is the product of her growing belief that a miscarriage of justice had taken place.<br><br>Sheila McGough was prosecuted and convicted because the government (and then the jury) interpreted her zealous representation of a con-man client named Bob Bailes as collaboration in his fraud. Malcolm's close readings of court records and her interviews with lawyers and businessmen connected with the case give <br>a picture of American law and American cupidity that is startling in its pitiless specificity. And her portrait of Sheila McGough--"a woman of almost preternatural honesty and decency," as well as maddening literal-mindedness and discursiveness--brings an unconventional new heroine into vivid being.</p><p>The inimitable Janet Malcolm has previously probed the soft white underbellies of psychiatry, journalism, literary biography, and a half-dozen other disciplines. In <i>The Crime of Sheila McGough</i>, she takes on the legal profession. At first glance this may seem like a ludicrously easy target: who doesn't have his doubts about the vast army of ambulance chasers, shysters, and corporate sharks? But as always, Malcolm has more complicated fish to fry. What fascinates her about the legal system is the endless, agonizing clash of contending narratives. "The transcripts of trials at law--even of routine criminal prosecutions and tiresome civil disputes--are exciting to read," she notes. "They record contests of wit and will that have the stylized structure and dire aura of duels before dawn."<p> To prove her point, Malcolm has chosen one particular prosecution--or, as the facts seem to indicate, persecution. In 1986 a Virginia attorney named Sheila McGough took on the case of a con artist named Bob Bailes. First she defended this charming chiseler against a charge of bank fraud, and lost; then, two years later, she went to bat for him when he was indicted for a bizarre, insurance-related bunco game. Again she lost, and Bailes--whose tale-spinning amounted to a kind of artistry--remained in the slammer. At this point, most advocates would have moved on. Not McGough: "After her client went to prison, she continued defending him as if nothing had happened.... She remained at his side and fought for him as if he were Alfred Dreyfus, instead of the small-time con man, with an unfortunate medical history and an interesting imagination, that he was." Nothing, it turns out, clogs the machinery of the judicial system more thoroughly than an honest--okay, <i>pathologically</i> honest--attorney.</p><p> As McGough continued to fight for her client, she aroused the wrath, and eventually the suspicion, of the court. Surely this nutty crusade must have some hidden agenda. Malcolm makes a strong argument for her subject's innocence: "Veracity was her defining characteristic, like the color of an orange. Her behavior may have been odd, deviant, maddening, but her devotion to the truth--almost like a disease in its helpless literalness--was an inspiriting given." The court, however, thought otherwise. In 1990 McGough was found guilty of 14 counts of felony (most of which made her an accessory to Bailes's depredations) and sentenced to 3 years in prison. Only after her release in 1996 did she enlist the author on her behalf. Unlike previous objects of Malcolm's scrutiny, McGough made little effort to finesse the narrative. All the more remarkable, then, that the most sublime cross-examiner in American letters found her innocent.</p><p> <i>The Crime of Sheila McGough</i> is, needless to say, a stinging critique of the legal system. "Without the thinner of common sense," the author insists, "the law is a toxic substance." (Malcolm, who's gotten a liberal serving of legal toxins during the 1980s and 1990s, is surely speaking from experience.) Yet her book is an equally brilliant brief on human behavior (and misbehavior). And as she plunges deeper into the legal labyrinth, her quest for the truth and nothing but the truth leads her to some superb insights about that <i>other</i> form of imaginative advocacy--writing. "The truth," she offers, "does not make a good story; that's why we have art." But in <i>The Crime of Sheila McGough</i>, Malcolm has it both ways. Deliciously witty and almost supernaturally aware, her book is a true crime story in <i>every</i> sense of the phrase. <i>--James Marcus</i></p><br>"No other writer tells better stories about the perpetual, the unwinnable, battle between narrative &amp; truth...She has again and again returned to one theme: the vexed relationship between the objective truth and the narrative truth we impose on it. Stories--those told by journalists and biographers, lawyers and witnesses--are always a violation of objective truth,even if they contain no overt lies. And yet we are dependent on them...The betrayals &amp; losses inherent in the imposition of narrative--and the power struggles over who will impose it--are Malcolm's great subject, her wellspring."--Margaret Talbot, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><p>"Janet Malcolm is the most morally illuminating literary journalist in the country,and <i>The Crime of Sheila McGough</i>, which I devoured in one sitting, epitomized the qualities I find so exciting in everything she writes. So much of Malcolm's work is a meditation on the unruliness of truth and its struggle against the neatly organized, tendentious stories with which unreliable narrators--biographers, prosecuters, defense lawyers, photographers, and psychoanalysts--try unsucessfully to contain it...In the McGough book, [Malcolm gives us] a breathtaking series of insights on the peculiarly treacherous nature of legal narrative."--Jeffrey Rosen, <i>Slate</i></p><p>"A beautifully written and tautly argued meditation-provocation on the law."<br>--Daniel Max, <i>Miami Herald</i> and <i>New York Observer</i></p></p><h2>Right Where You Are Sitting Now: Further Tales of the Illuminati (Visions Series)</h2><p>Discusses consciousness, the nature of God, sexuality, human knowledge, robots, and the future.<br></p><p></p><h2>The Journey: A Novel</h2><p>A major literary event: the first-ever English translation of a lost masterpiece of Holocaust literature by acclaimed author and survivor H. G. Adler<br><br>The story behind the story of <i>The Journey</i> is remarkable in itself: Award-winning translator Peter Filkins discovered an obscure German novel in a Harvard Square bookstore and, reading it, realized that it was a treasure unavailable to English speakers. It was the most powerful book by the late H. G. Adler, a survivor of Theresienstadt and Auschwitz, a writer whose work had been praised by authors from Elias Canetti to Heinrich B�ll and yet remained unknown to international audiences.<br><br>Written in 1950 after Adler&#x2019;s emigration to England, <i>The Journey</i> was not released in Germany until 1962. After the war, larger publishing houses stayed away from novels about the Holocaust, feeling that the tragedy could not be fictionalized and that any metaphorical interpretation was obscene. Only a small publisher was in those days willing to take on <i>The Journey</i>.<br><br>Yet Filkins found that Adler had depicted the event in a unique, truly modern, and deeply moving way. Avoiding specific mention of country or camps&#x2013;even of Nazis and Jews&#x2013;<i>The Journey</i> is a lyrical nightmare of a family&#x2019;s ordeal and one member&#x2019;s survival. Led by the doctor patriarch Leopold, the Lustig family finds itself &#x201c;forbidden&#x201d; to live, uprooted into a surreal and incomprehensible circumstance of deprivation and death. This cataclysm destroys father, daughter, sister, and wife and leaves only Paul, the son, to live again among those who saved or sacrificed him. <i>The Journey </i>reveals a world beset by an &#x201c;epidemic of mental illness . . . As a result of the epidemic, everyone was crazy, and once they finally recognized what was happening it was too late.&#x201d;<br><br>Linked by its innovative style to the work of James Joyce and Virginia Woolf, <i>The Journey</i> is as much a revelation as other recent discoveries on the subject as the works of W. G. Sebald and Ir�ne N�mirovsky&#x2019;s <i>Suite Francaise</i>. It is a book proving that art can portray the unimaginable and expand people&#x2019;s perceptions of it, a work anyone interested in recent history and modern literature must read.</p><p>H. G. Adler, born in Prague in 1910, was the author of twenty-six books of fiction, poetry, philosophy, and history. A survivor of Theresienstadt, Adler is best known for his studies of day-to-day life there, as documented in <i>Theresienstadt 1941-1945</i> and <i>Der verwaltete Mensch</i> (Administrated Man). Also a survivor of Auschwitz and Buchenwald, Adler lost his wife and her parents to the camps before leaving Czechoslovakia after the war to settle in England. Once there, he began writing novels about the Holocaust, <i>The Journey</i> being the first of five works of fiction. Working as a freelance writer and teacher throughout his life, Adler died in London in 1988.<br><br>Peter Filkins is the translator of Ingeborg Bachmann&#x2019;s collected poems, <i>Darkness Spoken</i>, as well as author of two books of poems: <i>What She Knew </i>and <i>After Homer</i>. The recipient of a Berlin Prize fellowship in 2005 from the American Academy in Berlin, he has also translated two of Bachmann&#x2019;s novels: <i>The Book of Franza </i>and <i>Requiem for Fanny Goldmann</i>.

Therefore there is no cause for grief. Also, it&#x2019;s best not to seek out too many opinions, because, by linking delusions and fears to which we are addicted, strong views keep you constantly drawn to what does not exist, or even if it did, would seem prohibited. So you find yourself inclined to agree with this or that notion, the emptiness of a sensible or blindly followed bit of wisdom, until you finally become aware of how unfathomable any view is, and that one is wise to quietly refrain from getting too involved with the struggles to salvage anything from the rubbish heap, life&#x2019;s course demanding this of us already.<br><br>Thus some measure of peace is attained. It&#x2019;s a peace found in endless flight, but nonetheless genuine peace. It is to be sure not an escape from yourself, no matter how much it may seem so, but rather the flight that consists of a ceaseless progression along the winding paths of a solitary realm, and because you abide in this realm you can call it peace, for upon time&#x2019;s stage everything remains fixed in the present. You&#x2019;re still a part of this. You travel many roads, and in many towns you appear with your relatives and friends; you stand, you walk, you fall and die. You don&#x2019;t believe you&#x2019;re still on the stage, even when you acknowledge you were once on it. But you&#x2019;re wrong, for they took you away and set you back onstage amid the fleeting journey. You didn&#x2019;t escape, even when you seemed suddenly sunk, figuratively and literally.<br><br>Yet what happens onstage? Many analogies are sought that often capture something essential, but none serves us better than the metaphor of the journey, which we can think of as flight. But what entity is it amid all these travels that recalls its own essence? It&#x2019;s memory itself, which sets out on the journey and is also dragged along through constant wandering. This entity, however, cannot leave its present location; that&#x2019;s why it acts in the present and finds space enough to unfold upon a single stage, which allows nothing else to appear but this entity capable of remembering itself, and so the image of the journey as flight arrives at a sense of peace, the entity that experiences it having been born in memory itself.<br><br>We are often reproached for the passivity of our beginning, of how reluctant we were to bring matters out into the open. But we cannot blame ourselves for our own expulsion, for that would imply that we wanted to give up. Thus we begin our search for a resting place ever anew; driven perhaps by an insatiability that in the end defines us, we are the heralds of life. The previously drawn analogy between the journey and peace becomes nothing but an analogy unto itself the moment we apply it in practical terms, becoming invalid in the world at large, because now everything appears to be in motion and indeed transforms itself entirely through motion. With good reason, one could speak of a passion or obsession that would sweep others along with us insofar as we are able to capture the living breath of our experience in motion. For indeed, we are our own creation; whether we are denied or accepted at our final end, when one must answer for oneself, much more depends, namely the flourishing of a world that, out of its deepest despair and highest aspirations, is called upon to form its own, in a certain sense, eternal countenance amid the destruction of our only meaningful and yet impalpable achievement, one accomplished in and for itself without the participation and help of the world at large.<br><br>Thus peace is let go and is gone, though not entirely; its reflection is and remains discernible for anyone who remains aware, amid the fear and horror of each single moment, when all dignity and secrecy are threatened, that an indestructible kernel persists beneath all the terror of this theater of horrors, a core, one which should never be idealized, since its existence is known only to the searching heart. The unmistakable persistence of this core as the last stop on this journey is at the same time your first and deepest memory, yet that is exactly what we are compelled to remember, the core being so omnipresent that it can be described as neither far nor near. Indeed, that is why it becomes obvious that in the flux of our lives memory always remains, and that, much like a memory, we&#x2014;and thus an entire world&#x2014;lack a stable, unchanging place in which to live. Thus we remain in flight, there is no rest for us but the interior that we remember; we are travelers on a journey that not a single one of us chose or planned. This we cannot change, the journey has begun, and now it follows its own path; as it progresses, it does not ask for our approval, it does not care if we love it or hate it, yet it stands in our way as soon as we ourselves resist the way.<br><br>Perhaps some still expect to hear where we are headed, or that at least some sense of it will be given. Be patient!&#x2014;for the aim here to try to depict this rather than describe it is the best response. Those who have their doubts can be assured that the destination will not be forgotten, since worries about the prospect of our final destination drive us all; that&#x2019;s why we will always make sure to keep the destination in mind, even if reports from the rubbish heap often seem to believe us.<br><br>One thing must be made clear, if we assert that we have suffered, suffered a great deal; by that we cannot and do not wish to set ourselves off from the world, which in itself experiences nothing but suffering, yet in our indefatigable readiness to embrace this suffering, we do not allow ourselves to sink further into the horror through which we cannot help but walk. No, we are not lost, even when we assert our loss, in fact the many losses that we&#x2014;alone for the most part and with our humble powers&#x2014;cannot make up for. But we have set ourselves on the stage. There, as elsewhere, we wish to appear alone, although we are not forsaken. We are never forsaken.<br><br>And so we wish to walk on or not walk at all&#x2014;for whether or not we walk on or make any progress is certainly not up to us nor anyone else. And so allow us to exist; whether it be in the perpetual motion that brings peace, whether it be in memory that ventures toward peace, either ahead of it or behind, whether it be in flight, one speaks of the fleeting nature of appearances, so let us exist in appearances and remain constantly in motion. Indeed, since our eyes are open, and suffering is not all we experience, but also life, allow us to grant this ever-changing existence so full of memory its only proper name&#x2014;the journey.</p><h2>The Heart Series, Second Edition: Unlocks the Secrets of Bridge Defense</h2><p>Ultimate book for learning how to defend bridge hands.

Kristy Thomas's brilliant business plan gets off to a great start with the help of Claudia Kishi (vice-president), Mary Anne Spier (secretary), and Stacey McGill (treasurer). <p></p> <strong>Amazon Exclusive Inteview with Author Ann M. Martin</strong> <p> Q: It's been a decade since the last Baby-sitters Club books came out, and 24 years since the first book was published. What was it like to come back to the BSC after so many years away?<br><br> <strong>Martin:</strong> I had a great time re-visiting the characters. It was fun to explore their lives in the prequel, &#x201c;"The Summer Before," and to figure out what led the girls to form The Baby-sitters Club, something that would eventually change their lives. It was like a reunion with friends--friends who haven&#x2019;t changed a bit. <br><br> <strong>Q:</strong> Kristy, Claudia, Mary Anne, and Stacey are very different characters, which is in part why the series was and is still so popular. Every reader can relate to at least one of the characters. So, we have to ask you--which character are you most like?<br><br> <strong>Martin:</strong> I am most like Mary Anne who is the shy and quiet one. Like me, Mary Anne enjoys more solitary pursuits such as reading and needlework. My favorite character, however, is Kristy. I think she's my alter ego.<br><br> <strong>Q:</strong> Were you allowed to baby-sit when you were twelve? If so, were they any funny or awful stories you'd like to share? <br><br> <strong>Martin: </strong> Yes, I did a lot of baby-sitting when I was twelve. One of the worst and also funniest things that ever happened was when I was baby-sitting for our neighbors and the kids wanted to wash their parents' car. They started the job with much enthusiasm--using Brillo pads. <br><br><strong>Q:</strong> More than 200 BSC books were published in the eighties and nineties. Are there any that you are particularly fond of and why?<br><br> <strong>Martin: </strong> My favorite Baby-sitters Club book is "Kristy's Great Idea," which is the first book and sets the series in motion. I also like the more serious books such as "Claudia and the Sad Good-bye," which deals with the death of Claudia&#x2019;s grandmother. This book was written shortly after my own grandmother died. My other favorite BSC books include &#x201c;Kristy and the Secret of Susan,&#x201d; in which the members of the BSC baby-sit for a child with autism, and "Jessi's Secret Language" in which the girls learn American Sign Language in order to communicate with a sitting charge with profound hearing impairment.<br><br> <strong>Q: </strong>Why do you think that the series is so well-loved and has endured over so many years? <br><br><strong>Martin:</strong> I think the characters in the BSC books are easily relatable. The books deal with timeless topics including friendship, family, and school. Also, the books tackle serious issues including racism, bullying, kids with disabilities (physical and mental), and death of a loved one. These issues were relevant to kids in the 1980s and 1990s, and are still relevant to kids today. In addition to being relatable, these are characters readers can aspire to. The kids run a business--in this case, a baby-sitting business. They are entrepreneurial, independent, creative, and confident. And at the heart of the series is the friendship--the "glue" that binds these characters. Sure, they have fights, but they're loyal and they support one another. I think a lot of us--even adults--can relate to that. <br><br> <strong>Q: </strong>"The Summer Before" takes place during the summer before the girls enter the seventh grade--where suddenly there's a ton of pressure to fit in. The months leading up to it can be filled with anxiety, excitement, and anticipation. Do you remember how you spent the summer before seventh grade? <br><br><strong>Martin:</strong> I was nervous that summer because in the fall I would be going to a new school &#x2013; the junior high (this was in the time before middle schools). Even the words "junior high" seemed terribly grown-up. My friends and I would be attending school with eighth-graders, who were one step away from high school. I spent that summer reading, going to the community pool, taking a family trip to Cape May, New Jersey, doing some baby-sitting, and also recovering from surgery. But the knowledge that I would soon be in junior high school colored every day and every activity and did lend the summer an air of both anxiety and anticipation.<br><br> <strong>Q:</strong> Despite the fun the girls have together in "The Summer Before," they're all dealing with pretty tough problems&#x2014;moving away, an absentee father, a first crush. How did you choose the issues you wanted to focus on?<br><br> <strong>Martin:&nbsp;</strong> One of my favorite things about writing a series was that the characters themselves generated plot ideas for later books. One of the themes that developed as the series progressed was that of Kristy's relationship with her father. It was an idea I enjoyed exploring, and when I had the opportunity to write the prequel I realized that this summer would be a charged time for Kristy, and that I could introduce the issues she had with her father here; then they could unfold in the later books. The same applied to Stacey. Her reasons for moving to Stoneybrook had been revealed in later books, but I realized that during this particular summer the reader could actually watch the events take place. The other issues &#x2013; a first crush, wanting more independence yet still feeling like a kid--are themes that I felt would resonate with most "tween" readers.<br><strong><br> Q: </strong>Even though the books have been out of print for ten years there are still some very devoted fans. Surely you must have received a ton of letters about the series over the years. Are there any that stick out in your mind?<br><br> <strong>Martin:</strong> The most memorable are stories of girls who have written to me and told me that I&#x2019;ve made an impact on their lives, that The Baby-sitters Club books have turned them into readers. Some have also said that the BSC books made them aspire to become writers. I&#x2019;ve also heard from a lot of the original fans who grew up to become teachers, librarians, editors, journalists, entrepreneurs, etc. To know that this series inspired a generation of readers and writers is very humbling. <br><br> <strong>Q:</strong> There&#x2019;s been a lot of speculation in the blogosphere about where Claudia, Kristy, Mary Ann, and Stacey would be now, in 2010, had they grown up. Do you have any thoughts on what path each would have taken?<br><br> <strong>Martin:</strong>&nbsp; I understand the fascination of the older BSC fans who would like to know what happened with the characters when they got older. It&#x2019;s thrilling to realize that after all these years the fans remain passionate about the books and the characters in The Baby-sitters Club. I can see Kristy running a business--I can also see her being in politics. I think Mary Anne became a teacher. I imagine Stacey went into fashion--not as a designer, but maybe on the business side. And Claudia became an artist. I think fans can fill in for the rest of the characters!<br><br> </p>Ann M.

This collection, a representative sampling of a decade of &#34;My Day&#34; pieces, reveals a First Lady unconventional for her time in her role as the president&#39;s peripatetic and reliable observer of world affairs, yet deeply traditional in observance of the rituals of family and friendships. As an advocate of progressive social programs, she was often the target of brickbats and caricature. Yet typical devotion to her can be found in a quote here of Adlai Stevenson, &#34;Her glow . . . warmed the world.&#34; An ability to laugh at herself, to triumph over personal adversity in her own and in her chil dren&#39;s marriages, and a genuine interest in people are reflected in these columns, to which average Americans then and now can be responsive.</p><p>YA-- These reminiscences are as fresh today as they were 53 years ago. This first of two volumes details the New Deal era, the effect of World War II on the country, Roosevelt's personal travels, and the Roosevelts' family life from 1936--1945. The introduction by Roosevelt's longtime friend, Martha Gellhorn, sets the time and circumstance of this amazing woman who remains one of our most respected first ladies. Chadakoff has skillfully chosen pertinent columns and has added historical documentation to enlighten readers about the context in which they belong. In addition to their historic value, the columns give readers a clear picture of the fishbowl existence of the first lady. Eleanor Roosevelt's insights, compassion, and ambition are clearly evident in this unique perspective on history that can be enjoyed by a broad spectrum of readers.<br><i>- Anne Paget, Episcopal High School, Bellaire, TX</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Eleanor Roosevelt's "day" for nearly 30 years was not finished until she had recorded something in it for the millions who read her syndicated newspaper column, "My Day." This book samples the some 3000 deadlines she met, six days a week, while First Lady. The columns are not memorable as journalism, but for those knowing her only as a historical figure they offer a sense of the way Roosevelt touched contemporaries. Whether attending the theater or a hog calling, sharing tea with Mussolini or hot dogs with the King and Queen of England, or, finally, in a eulogy for her husband, these dispatches show Roosevelt as a woman of great warmth and no affectation.

Young ex-jockey Freddie Croft owns a profitable fleet of horse vans that convey runners to the course. A man who has few illusions about racing&#39;s smarmier aspects, Freddie is a stickler for security. But even he is startled by the violence that erupts when a hard, fast rule is broken: Never pick up a hitchhiker. In what will be the first of many ironies, the passenger - not the driver - turns up dead. And if one corpse is bad for business, what happens next could well be fatal: Freddie is swept unknowingly into the vortex of a malign conspiracy in which appearances deceive and the cost of being duped is murderously high.

By tracing certain words in common use millennia ago ( wopsa , for instance) from, say, an Indo-European root through Old Norse or Middle Dutch or Old Icelandic, he demonstrates how such words are remarkably similar to their descendants in modern English ( wasp ). Many words he finds both "lovely and lovable" ( civility , for example), but not all. Looking askance at offal , he would do away with surly , and happily explains why. Thomas points out that children make language, citing a grandson's amusing coinage. Commenting that a universal language is probably inevitable, he briefly inquires into the Gaia theory (Planet Earth as living organism). These and other minor excursions are firmly tied to his overall theme: language not only binds and unites us, it is what makes us unique. Thomas's gentle ruminations will be enjoyed by those who share his etymological enchantment. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.Well known as a writer about science ( The Lives of a Cell, 1974; The Medusa and the Snail, LJ 4/15/79), Thomas has applied his probing mind to etymology, here tracing English words back to their Indo-European, Greek, Sanskrit, Anglo-Saxon, Latin, or Romance language variants in both form and meaning. Although Thomas surely enjoyed the hunt, the reader is presented with a hodgepodge of words not easily remembered in chapters entitled "Sew, Bear, Brother, Dew etc.," "Fastidious, Answer, Grammar etc.," and "Scrutiny, Frenetic, Bother, Stop etc." This thin volume is not thorough enough to be an etymological reference and not interesting enough to be entertaining for word fanciers.<br><i>- Kitty Chen Dean, Nassau Coll., Garden City, N.Y.</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Bishop&#39;s Boys: A Life of Wilbur and Orville Wright</h2><p>Tells the story of the Wright brothers who invented to first airplane</p><p>Tom D. Crouch, author of The Bishop's Boys and A Dream of Wings, is senior curator of the aeronautics division at the National Air &amp; Space Museum. He lives in Fairfax, Virginia.Milton Wright, father of Wilbur and Orville, was an itinerant churchman embroiled in controversies who bequeathed to his sons firmness of purpose, stubborn independence and overweening pride, qualities that were to inform their lives. After the bachelor brothers perfected the world's first practical airplane, their extreme secretiveness and haughty manner alienated potential business partners. Determined to protect their invention, the duo became litigious, undertaking a string of patent-infringement lawsuits that consumed their energies and very possibly contributed to Wilbur's death at age 45 in 1912. Orville, who finally reaped a fortune from the sale of the Wright Company, spent his last years tinkering on small-scale projects. He died in 1948. Crouch ( A Dream of Wings ) interweaves family drama with the history of aviation in a riveting saga of ingenuity, competing claims, public adulation and technical innovation. More than 10 years in the writing, with benefit of cooperation from the Wright family, this comprehensive biography throws light as well on Will and Orv's long-suffering sister Katherine, head of the household (their mother died in 1889), who held the family together while their father crisscrossed the country. The book also contains fresh glimpses of rival pioneers--American, French, German--and their magnificent flying machines.

God is ruthless in His love and pursuit of us; it&#x2019;s time for His Bride to reflect the same passion.<br>&nbsp;<br>John Bevere explores how people of Bible times and today became relentless: John the Baptist spent years living in a barren desert. Jesus endured hardship in a desolate wilderness of temptation. Both men emerged strong in the &#x201c;power of the Spirit,&#x201d; relentless in not just getting through challenges but in ruling over their circumstances. Ultimately, they succeeded in their God-given life mission.<br>&nbsp;<br>In <i>Relentless</i>, you&#x2019;ll learn how even seemingly impossible situations were never meant to stop you but to propel you forward in your journey. Discover in these biblically grounded truths how you can thrive no matter what your season of life.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br>How you begin is not nearly as important as how you finish. Embrace your trials and become relentless!<br><br><b>Questions for reflection and discussion included!</b></p><p><p>John Bevere is the author of such bestsellers <i>as Extraordinary, The Bait of Satan, The Fear of the Lord, Under Cover</i>, and <i>Driven by Eternity</i>. His books have been translated into over sixty languages, and his weekly television program, The Messenger, is broadcast around the world. John is a popular speaker at conferences and churches and his ministry, Messenger International, offers resources to those who want to understand and apply God&#x2019;s principles. John&#x2019;s wife, Lisa, is also a bestselling author and speaker. They live with their family in Colorado.</p>I imagine you agree with me on this: how we &#x201c;finish&#x201d; is more important than how we &#x201c;begin.&#x201d;<br><br>In the Christian life, the ultimate finish will be having our Lord say to us at the end, &#x201c;Well done, My good and faithful servant!&#x201d;<br><br>What will it take for you and me to hear those remarkable words from the One who means everything to us?<br><br>To finish life well requires that we live life well. This certainly includes knowing how to &#x201c;never give up.&#x201d; It means having a relentless spirit. How do we acquire that? And why is it so important?<br><br>Honestly, I am concerned that many believers are not going to finish well. God once gave me a sobering vision that relates to the theme of this book. A man was rowing a boat against the river&#x2019;s strong current. He was straining hard to advance against the flow of the water&#x2014;a tough task, but doable.<br><br>Other boats, bigger and luxurious and containing parties of people, frequently passed him flowing downstream. The people on these boats were laughing, drinking, and at ease. Occasionally they would look over at the man battling the current and mock him. He had to fight for every inch of progress while they did very little to absolutely nothing for theirs. After a while the man grew weary of pressing against the current.<br><br>Tired and discouraged, he put up the oars. For a few moments he continued to drift upstream from the momentum, but soon came to a standstill. Then something sad and terrible happened: though still pointed upstream, his rowboat began to drift downstream with the current.<br><br>Soon the man noticed another party boat. This one was different from the other party boats for&#x2014;like his own rowboat&#x2014;this party boat also was pointed upstream, yet was flowing downstream with the current. This boat also carried people who were laughing, socializing, and at ease. Since it was pointed upstream&#x2014;the direction the man had wanted to go&#x2014;he decided to hop on and join with them. They now became a close-knit group. Unlike the other party boats that faced and traveled downstream, this boat pointed upstream. But, sadly, it continued flowing downstream with the current.<br><br>What is the interpretation of this vision? The river represents the world and the rowboat is our human body that enables us to live and function in this world. The man in the rowboat is a believer; his oars symbolize God&#x2019;s unmerited grace. The party boats depict those joined in one purpose, and the river&#x2019;s current represents the flow of this world, which is under the sway of the evil one. By the oars of grace, the man has the ability to resist the current and move<br>upstream to his destiny in advancing the kingdom of God. His physical strength represents his faith. Sadly, his strength wanes and he grows weary of the fight. He doesn&#x2019;t think he has what it takes, when in reality he does. Consequently, he eventually runs out of steam and quits.<br><br>Once the man quits rowing, the boat continues moving forward (upstream) for a short time due to sheer momentum. And this is where deception moves in. He still sees some fruit in his life, even though what produced it no longer propels him. He erroneously thinks he can live at ease&#x2014;no longer alert and vigilant&#x2014;and still lead a successful Christian life.<br><br>Finally, the boat comes to a standstill, and then it begins to drift backward (downstream)&#x2014;slowly at first, but eventually at the same speed as the current.<br><br>Here&#x2019;s the telling part of the vision: while his boat is still pointed upstream, he drifts backward with the current. He now has the appearance of Christianity&#x2014;knows the talk, the songs, and the mannerisms of the kingdom&#x2014;but in reality he is conforming to the ways of the world (see 1 John 2:15&#x2013;17).<br><br>Eventually our protagonist spots another boat, a party of other &#x201c;believers&#x201d; like him. They all consider themselves part of the church because they, too, are pointed upstream. They know the talk, the songs, and the mannerisms. However,<br>they are at ease because they&#x2019;ve settled for a fruitless &#x201c;Christian&#x201d; life and are under the sway of the evil one who controls the current.<br><br>Those in this &#x201c;Christianity boat&#x201d; are no longer persecuted or mocked by the nonbelieving world. In fact, they are accepted and sometimes hailed by the world&#x2019;s influencers. They no longer press, press, press forward as the apostle Paul encouraged every Christian to do: &#x201c;I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus&#x201d; (Philippians 3:14). In fact, these drifting believers have little or no resistance to the ways of the world.<br><br>Consider what the apostle John wrote:<br>Practically everything that goes on in the world&#x2014;wanting your own way, wanting everything for yourself, wanting to appear important&#x2014;has nothing to do with the Father. It just isolates you from him. The world and all its wanting, wanting, wanting is on the way out&#x2014;but whoever does what God wants is set for eternity. (1 John 2:16&#x2013;17, msg) The vision I&#x2019;ve described for you depicts three types of people: the believer, the unbeliever, and the deceived.<br><br>-&nbsp;The unbeliever just flows with the current, oblivious to the reality of wanting, wanting, wanting.<br><br>-&nbsp;The believer must press, press, press in the fight of faith to attain kingdom advancement.<br><br>-&nbsp;The deceived hides his or her motive of wanting, wanting, wanting through &#x201c;Christian appearance&#x201d; and the misuse of Scripture.<br><br>I know this vision presents a disturbing view of people of faith today, but it forces each of us to ask a vitally important question: &#x201c;Which person do I resemble?&#x201d; After all, God&#x2019;s Word commands us to...<br><br>Test yourselves to make sure you are solid in the faith. Don&#x2019;t drift along taking everything for granted. Give yourselves regular checkups. You need firsthand evidence, not mere hearsay, that Jesus Christ is in you. Test it out.<br>If you fail the test, do something about it. (2 Corinthians 13:5, msg) After seeing this vision and becoming aware of its interpretation, I became even more convicted by these words written to the Hebrew Christians: Lift up your tired hands, then, and strengthen your trembling knees! Keep walking on straight paths.... Guard against turning back from the grace of God. (Hebrews 12:12&#x2013;13, 15, tev)<br><br>As children of God, we should desperately want to finish well for His glory. You and I should never want to turn back from God&#x2019;s grace by growing weary, putting up our oars, and drifting with the current of this world&#x2019;s system. We need look no further than Scripture to find examples of what happens when people do or do not finish well. Consider Solomon, son of David and the wisest, richest, most powerful man of his time. He achieved heights that no human being for generations before or many afterward even came close to. However, he faltered&#x2014;put up his oars&#x2014;in the latter part of his reign, turning his heart from God to align with the world&#x2019;s system.<br><br>Because Solomon had many foreign wives, more than likely he experienced tremendous conflict within his household over being single-minded in his allegiance and obedience to Jehovah. In order to keep peace, he did not remain loyal<br>to Jehovah, but rather built altars for and even worshiped his favored wives&#x2019; foreign gods.<br><br>Solomon suffered greatly from his folly, but his children and grandchildren were affected even more profoundly. The kingdom that was entrusted to him, one that was strong from his father David&#x2019;s faithfulness and grew even stronger<br>with Solomon&#x2019;s excellent start, suffered, was divided, and eventually withered from his failure to finish well. Israel&#x2019;s history would have been significantly different if Solomon had remained relentless.<br><br>Now let&#x2019;s compare Solomon with John the Baptist. John was resolute and held fast to truth, valiantly living and proclaiming it. He, like Solomon, was faced with adversity, but John&#x2019;s potential consequences were far worse, for it<br>wasn&#x2019;t a wife or several but the king of Judea who didn&#x2019;t embrace the truth John proclaimed. Solomon faced a conflicted household, but John faced jail, torture, and possibly even death. Yet in the face of such cruel and extreme consequences, John remained immovable in his stance for truth, both in how he lived and the message he proclaimed. The result: John&#x2019;s legacy is superior to Solomon&#x2019;s. Not only did John and Solomon face adversity&#x2014;a rapid river&#x2019;s current&#x2014;but so do you and I. We are in a serious battle against the world&#x2019;s vain, shallow values. Its influence is powerful. Deceptive. Alluring. It&#x2019;s far too easy to grow weary, to think it&#x2019;s okay to cease our perseverance, give in, and drift with the prevailing currents. But the only way for you and me to finish strong is to be relentless in our faith. In doing so we will become something to be reckoned with, a genuine threat to the kingdom of darkness.</p><h2>Rogets Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases 150th Anniversary E</h2><p>Roget&#39;s Thesaurus is the world&#39;s most famous and trusted word-finder.

As the smoke slowly clears, Remy finds that his memory is skipping, lurching between moments of lucidity and days when he doesn't seem to be living his own life at all. The landscape around him is at once fractured and oddly familiar: a world dominated by a Machiavellian mayor known as "The Boss," and peopled by gawking celebrities, anguished policemen peddling First Responder cereal, and pink real estate divas hyping the spoils of tragedy. Remy himself has a new girlfriend he doesn't know, a son who pretends he's dead, and an unsettling new job chasing a trail of paper scraps for a shadowy intelligence agency known as the Department of Documentation. Whether that trail will lead Remy to an elusive terror cell&#x2014;or send him circling back to himself&#x2014;is only one of the questions posed by this provocative yet deeply human novel.</p><p>From a novelist of astounding talent, <em>The Zero</em> is an extraordinary story of how our trials become our transgressions, of how we forgive ourselves and whether or not we should.</p></p><p><p>Jess Walter is the author of six novels, including the bestsellers <em>Beautiful Ruins</em> and <em>The Financial Lives of the Poets</em>, the National Book Award finalist <em>The Zero</em>, and <em>Citizen Vince</em>, the winner of the Edgar Award for best novel.

He lives in his hometown of Spokane, Washington.</p>There's a difficulty with recording a grim satire that has nothing to do with the talent of the narrator. (Christopher Graybill is quite wonderful here, warm and skillful.) Black humor lies in the disjunction between the awful things happening to the protagonist and the reader's perception of how absurd it is. On the page it's comic when Gulliver is captured by tiny Lilliputians, to us, but not to Gulliver. Apparently, on the page this novel of a Kafka-esque version of New York after 9/11 is darkly funny; but to hear it well read is to identify with Walter's protagonist, for whom this alternate universe is terrifying and confusing, physically and morally. Quite brilliant, but clearly different to hear than to read with your eyes.

Henry Wallace is dead. A behind-the-scenes operator at the CIA, Wallace was integral to the Agency&#x2019;s secret war against China&#x2019;s national intelligence service, which infiltrates government and military offices, major businesses, and systems crucial to our security. Wallace had severely damaged China&#x2019;s Washington spy ring with a devastating ruse, a so-called &#x201c;black swan,&#x201d; in which a deep-undercover female agent targeted and destroyed a key Chinese official. Now, Wallace&#x2019;s mysterious death suggests that the CIA itself has been compromised and that China has someone inside the Agency. </p><p> But as Allender quietly investigates, he makes a shocking discovery that will upend the entire American intelligence apparatus.

So was the French poet, Paul Claudel. Kathleen Norris is an oblate, and so was Elena Lucrezia Cornaro Piscopia, the first woman in Europe to earn a Ph.D. What connects them all? There are at least ten thousand oblates in the United States today (no one knows for sure how many), and each of them is connected in meaningful ways to a monastery or abbey. Most oblates are ordinary lay people from various Christian traditions. They are linked together by common appreciation for the Rule of St. Benedict. Originally written for monks, the principles in the Rule may be applied by everyone else---and in today&#39;s hectic, changing world, being an oblate offers a rich spiritual connection to the stability and wisdom of monastic life. This essential guide explains how people who live and work in &#34;the world&#34; are still invited to balance work with prayer, cultivate interdependence with others, practice hospitality, and otherwise practice their spirituality like monks.</p><p>Brother Benet Tvedten entered the Blue Cloud Abbey in Marvin, South Dakota in 1958. He has been his community&#39;s Director of Oblates for nearly thirty years, and held the position of Coordinator of the North American Association of Oblate Directors between 1995 and 1999. He is also the author of A View from a Monastery.IN RECENT YEARS I've seen a number of new books on monastic life, prayer and the application of Benedictine spirituality in the workplace. How to Be a Monastic and Not Leave Your Day job and Oblation, two of seven titles incorporating those principles that are currently available from Paraclete Press, specifically address the oblate vocation. As expressed in Brother Benet's title, the road to holiness traveled by vowed religious is open to anyone, and can be found wherever we are, regardless of age, race, sex, occupation (or lack thereof) or even marital status. Benedictine oblates are Christian men and women who affiliate with a specific Benedictine community. Through oblate programs organized by almost every monastery, these mostly laypeople learn from professional monastics (monks and nuns) how to apply the Rule of St. Benedict to their daily lives. Brother Benet, a monk of Blue Cloud Abbey in South Dakota and director of its oblate program, combines explanations of what is meant by Benedictine spirituality with practical examples of its implementation, contributed by oblates of various monasteries. "Christ is the chain that binds us," he says, "and we are all bound to one another." Section one on Benedictine spirituality shows how prayer, holy reading, work and relationships figure in the life of every monastic. Prominent among the spirituality Benedictine values for daily living in section two are peace and justice, and hospitality. Two uniquely Benedictine vows conversion of life and stability of heart-are discussed in section three on being an oblate. Although oblates do not take vows, we promise to practice these concepts. Also found in this section are a helpful history of the oblate movement and five simple guidelines for oblates, prepared over 30 years ago by a group of oblate directors. <i>St. Anthony's Messenger</i> November 1, 2006<br><br>These two books [Oblation: Meditations on St. Benedict's Rule by Rachel M. Srubas and How To Be a Monastic and Not Leave Your Day Job: An Invitation to Oblate Life by Brother Benet Tvedten] deserve dual consideration. Both issued by Paraclete, they make a powerful case for the revival of one of the less well known monastic traditions of the West, the "oblates," who, while remaining laypeople in a lay life, are affiliated with a monastic house by their adherence to some of the basic tenets of the Benedictine rule. Tvedten (director, Oblates, Blue Cloud Abbey, SD) explains the history of Benedictine monasticism simply but in some detail as well as the history of oblates and their place in contemporary monastic houses, both Catholic and non-Catholic Benedictine. Srubas, herself both a Benedictine oblate and a Presbyterian clergywoman, has written a collection of poem-like prayers and meditations directed at oblates and inspired by the Benedictine rule. These volumes cast fresh light on a little-known practice and should interest many readers. For most collections. Graham Christian <i>Library Journal</i> January 1, 2006</p><h2>Crazy Salad: Some Things About Women</h2><p>The absurdities and realities of female existence in the early 1970&#39;s are incisively chronicled</p><p><i>Crazy Salad,</i> by screenwriting legend and novelist Nora Ephron, is an extremely funny, deceptively light look at a generation of women (and men) who helped shape the way we live now. In this distinctive, engaging, and simply hilarious view of a period of great upheaval in America, Ephron turns her keen eye and wonderful sense of humor to the media, politics, beauty products, and women's bodies. In the famous "A Few Words About Breasts," for example, she tells us: "If I had had them, I would have been a completely different person. I honestly believe that."

His book <i>A Maiden's Grave</i> was made into an HBO movie starring James Garner and Marlee Matlin, and his novel <i>The Bone Collector</i> was made into a feature release from Universal Pictures, starring Denzel Washington. He lives in North Carolina.</i> <p> </p><p> It's always a pleasure to see a new installment in the saga of Temperence Brennan, the forensic anthropologist who plies her trade in both Charlotte, North Carolina, and Montreal. </p><p> <i>Devil Bones</i>, set in the U S of A, opens with a grisly discovery that offers a very different take on <i>This Old House</i>. Tempe is pulled from staid academia to investigate the troubling and mystifying scene, which involves cauldrons, ceremonial religious artifacts and, most troubling, the severed head of a teenage girl. </p><p> Another torso is located nearby, and the story is off and running. </p><p> Tempe and Charlotte police department detective Erskine "Skinny" Slidell, follow leads that take them through the seamier and the chicer sides of North Carolina's largest city--the worlds of Santeria, voodoo, the Wiccan religion (any witches out there: I'm not lumping them together!), and male prostitution. Our heroine also locks horns with a crusading minister turned politician, and there's a reporter who manages to show up at all the wrong moments. </p><p> Reichs juggles the questions of who done it (and who's gonna get done next) until the very end with consummate skill. In series books, readers treat characters as friends and follow those storylines as ardently as the ones involving murder and mayhem. Not content to keep things simmering on low boil, Reichs dunks her protagonist into a pressure cooker, with plenty of turmoil stirred up by a former lover, a--possibly--current one and, most significantly for this reader, yet another ghost of life past, about which I'll say no more here. Trouble on campus also surfaces for Professor Brennan, with whom we experience one of the most harrowing moments in the book: a meeting of professors and department heads (university politics as weapon of mass destruction). Oh, and we can't forget some brief appearances by the ex, who is behaving just like, well, an ex. </p><p> It might have been my imagination but I believe too that I saw the bones, if you will, of a possible subplot involving Tempe's daughter, Katy, who's working in the public defender's office. I'm looking forward to seeing Reich confirm or deny this in the next installment. </p><p> In <i>Devil Bones</i> we get plenty of what we've come to expect in a Reichs novel: engrossing details on forensic anthropology and anatomical science. Her mastery, and love, of those subjects, which Reichs herself practices (in both Montreal and Charlotte, by the way), is evident in her writing. We're also treated to plenty of esoterica about non-mainstream religions and history (I mean, I live in North Carolina and didn't know Charlotte was named for a seventeen-year-old German duchess). The author deftly negotiates that fine line between using such information to enhance the experience of reading a novel and padding prose. She gives us what we need to know--to enrich plot, character or atmosphere--and then gets back to the story. </p><p> And speaking of which: As an author writing in the same genre, I was impressed with Reichs's ability to keep the roller coaster on track and speeding along, page after page. She's a true master of cliff hangers--a neglected skill in a field where far too many lazy authors end chapters with people leaving rooms, falling asleep or offering hand-tipping foreshadowings of what's to come. I call this the question-mark factor and when writing my thriller I actually tally up the number of scenes that end in a compelling, unresolved issue that drives the reader forward. </p><p> Reichs has question marks aplenty. </p><p> My one complaint: I read the novel in one sitting. But I'm hoping that while poor Tempe may want a break after everything that happens to her in <i>Devil Bones</i>, author Reichs isn't giving her any rest and is hard at work on number 12. </p><p> <i>--Jeffery Deaver</i> <br> </p>Kathy Reichs, like her character Temperance Brennan, is a forensic anthropologist, formerly for the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in North Carolina and currently for the Laboratoire de sciences judiciaires et de m�decine l�gale for the province of Quebec.

It has been acknowledged for centuries as the cornerstone of spiritual awakening in all traditions of Eastern thought. In the West, however, it is still a relatively unrecognized concept of living. The Western mind is always restless, never content with the moment. Its internal dialogue is always firing off thoughts filled with emotional content and pulling the individual out of the present and into the past or future. But individuals raised in Western culture are becoming increasingly more aware of their overall sense of mental exhaustion, their lack of discipline and their inability to focus on demand. They are willing to expend the energy necessary to experience inner peace and a quiet mind that is waiting to follow the direction of their will. They are realizing that the endless struggle to fulfill the insatiable appetite of instant gratification is fruitless and tiresome at best. They are ripe for a new path in life and eager for a new set of instructions. This is the purpose of The Practicing Mind. It comprehensively deals with helping the individual understand exactly what present moment awareness is, how we are raised in a manner contradictory to this, and how we change our mindset to make this a part of our daily living. This book is accessible to readers of all philosophical backgrounds. Regardless of your perspective, you will find the book's insights most compelling.<br><b>You can find the wisdom of both <i>The Practicing Mind</i> and <i>The Meditating Mind<i> in the combination package: <i>The Total Mindset.</i></i></i></b><i><i><i><br><b>For your convenience, THE PRACTICING MIND is now in mp3 CD audiobook format.</b></i></i></i></p><p>In those times when we want to acquire a new skill or face a formidable challenge we hope to overcome, what we need most are patience, focus, and discipline, traits that seem elusive or difficult to maintain. In this enticing and practical book, Thomas Sterner demonstrates how to learn skills for any aspect of life, from golfing to business to parenting, by learning to love the process.<br><br>Early life is all about trial-and-error practice. If we had given up in the face of failure, repetition, and difficulty, we would never have learned to walk or tie our shoes. So why, as adults, do we often give up on a goal when at first we don&#x2019;t succeed? Modern life&#x2019;s technological speed, habitual multitasking, and promises of instant gratification don&#x2019;t help. But in his study of how we learn (prompted by his pursuit of disciplines such as music and golf), Sterner has found that we have also forgotten the principles of practice the process of picking a goal and applying steady effort to reach it. The methods Sterner teaches show that practice done properly isn&#x2019;t drudgery on the way to mastery but a fulfilling process in and of itself, one that builds discipline and clarity.<br><br>By focusing on process, not product,&#x201d; you&#x2019;ll learn to live in each moment, where you&#x2019;ll find calmness and equanimity. This book will transform a sense of futility around learning something challenging into an attitude of pleasure and willingness.<br>Thomas M. Sterner spent over 25 years as a concert piano technician and rebuilder. Preparing instruments for the finest world class concert pianists and symphony musicians enabled him to witness first-hand the level of art afforded to those with a disciplined mind. His career also provided a strong impetus toward inner awareness, dovetailing with his spiritual search for the truth and inner peace. The solitary and monotonous nature of his work afforded him the time and opportunity to assimilate all that he has learned over the years, to infuse this knowledge into his work and daily life, and to continue to develop his practicing mind. An accomplished musician himself, Mr. Sterner lives in Delaware, happily engaged in composing music, writing inspirational, self-help books and publishing audio books through his company, Mountain Sage Publishing.</p><h2>Smaug: Unleashing the Dragon (The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug)</h2><p><p><strong>Come face to face with Smaug the Magnificent, the most realistic, breathtaking and destructive dragon ever to appear on screen, in this gallery of exclusive images that tell the story of how he was created.</strong></p><p>Smaug is possibly the most memorable character in JRR Tolkien&#x2019;s <em>The Hobbit</em>: a huge, malevolent, fire-breathing, talking dragon!

Lady Alice, widowed duchess of Suffolk, needs Frevisse's support in burying her husband, as the late but not lamented duke was so hated that even being in the presence of his corpse is unsafe. And when men in Suffolk's employ start disappearing, Frevisse fears for her cousin's safety.<br> <br> Wandering player Simon Joliffe has also come to London, filling the role of courier for the exiled duke of York and bringing vital information - a list bearing the names of the English noblemen who purportedly betrayed their King by conspiring with the French.

She has a marvelous way of weaving historical details, facts, politics, and the ins and outs of everyday medieval life into the fabric of her novels. If history texts were written in such a fascinating way, I'm convinced that every schoolchild would become a scholar." - CA Reviews</i></p><p>Margaret Frazer was a finalist for an Edgar(r) Award for both <i>The Servant's Tale</i> and <i>The Prioress' Tale</i>.As the Hundred Years' War against France approaches a resolution in 1450, Frazer's clever Benedictine nun, Dame Frevisse, emerges from her Oxfordshire abbey to solve a string of politically motivated murders in this illuminating but dialogue-heavy 16th installment (after 2006's The Sempster's Tale) in the author's medieval mystery series. Dame Frevisse joins forces with her old partner in sleuthing, Master Joliffe Norreys, when the duke of Suffolk, husband to her cousin Lady Alice, is killed. Several more men under Suffolk die or disappear, and Dame Frevisse links their fates to a sensitive missing letter from the duke of Suffolk to the duke of Somerset, that may hint the British lost Normandy by "deliberate treachery." As always, the pious Dame Frevisse wishes to be left in peace, but fraught circumstances compel her to do her best to help achieve justice. Although this slow-moving tale is not quite up to Frazer's usual standard, the author provides an interesting history lesson.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

These include not only famous and expected names (Harriet Beecher Stowe, Willa Cather, Dorothy Parker, Flannery O&#x2019;Connor, Gwendolyn Brooks, Grace Paley, Toni Morrison, and Jodi Picoult among them), but also many who were once successful and acclaimed yet now are little known, from the early American best-selling novelist Catherine Sedgwick to the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning playwright Susan Glaspell. Showalter shows how these writers--both the enduring stars and the ones left behind by the canon--were connected to one another and to their times. She believes it is high time to fully integrate the contributions of women into our American literary heritage, and she undertakes the task with brilliance and flair, making the case for the unfairly overlooked and putting the overrated firmly in their place.</p> <p>Whether or not readers agree with the book&#x2019;s roster of writers, A Jury of Her Peers is an irresistible invitation to join the debate, to discover long-lost great writers, and to return to familiar titles with a deeper appreciation. It is a monumental work that will greatly enrich our understanding of American literary history and culture.</p> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: Elaine Showalter's Top Ten Books by American Women Writers You Haven't Read (But Should)</strong> <br><br> Everyone knows the handful of novels by American women writers, from <i>Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Cabin</i> to <i>The House of Mirth</i> and <i>Beloved</i>, that make it onto standard reading lists. But there are hundreds of wonderful books by American women that have been underestimated, overlooked, or forgotten.<br> <p>Here&#x2019;s my starting guide to ten extraordinary works of fiction--one from each decade of the twentieth century--that deserve to be much better known.</p> <p></p><li><b><i>The Country of Lost Borders</i> by Mary Hunter Austin (1909)</b><br> A moving collection of stories emphasizing the California landscape and the vulnerability of women, especially Native American women who were seduced and abandoned by white men in the Wild West. The memorable final story about a mysterious woman in the desert, &#x201c;The Walking Woman,&#x201d; is Austin&#x2019;s manifesto of female independence, equality, tenderness, and sorrow. </li><p></p> <p></p><li><b><i>Herland</i> by Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1915)</b><br> Gilman&#x2019;s clever utopian novel imagines three American men on a scientific expedition who hear tales of a &#x201c;strange and terrible Woman Land in the high distance,&#x201d; and decide to find and invade it. Expecting to rule over the women, the men are astounded, entranced, and defeated by the resourcefulness of an all-female society.</li><p></p> <p></p><li><b><i>The Home-Maker</i> by Dorothy Canfield Fisher (1924)</b><br> Fisher was a prolific novelist, a judge for the Book of the Month Club, and a pioneer of Montessori education in the U.S. She claimed that <i>The Home-Maker</i> was more about children&#x2019;s rights than women&#x2019;s rights, but she empathized with all the members of a middle-class family whose lives are being destroyed by the straitjacket of maintaining proper male and female roles. When an accident forces the husband and wife to change places, everyone is much happier. This could be a comic premise--Mr. Mom--but Fisher treats it with seriousness and psychological insight. </li><p></p> <p></p><li><b><i>The Unpossessed</i> by Tess Slesinger (1934)</b><br> Slesinger used her disillusion with the whole cultural spectrum of the 1930s for her sparkling satire of the New York leftwing editors of a radical magazine. The novel is both a penetrating autobiographical portrait of the divided woman intellectual of the decade, painfully torn between party politics and personal emancipation; and a timeless and very funny lampoon of ideologues driven by vanity, political trendiness, and competition. </li><p></p> <p></p><li><b><i>The Mountain Lion</i> by Jean Stafford (1947)</b><br> Stafford was at her best in this powerful coming-of-age novel about a young brother and sister, Ralph and Molly Fawcett, who spend their summers at their grandfather&#x2019;s ranch in Colorado. While Ralph is being initiated into adventurous manhood, Molly is fiercely and tragically resisting the dull femininity which lies in store for her.</li><p></p> <p></p><li><b><i>Maud Martha</i> by Gwendolyn Brooks (1953)</b><br> The only novel by the poet Gwendolyn Brooks, <i>Maud Martha</i> tells the story of a poor black Chicago housewife, in a lyrical form like that of Virginia Woolf&#x2019;s <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>, but suffused with anger against racism, war, and the daily small tragedies of black women&#x2019;s lives. An American classic. </li><p></p> <p></p><li><b><i>We Have Always Lived in the Castle</i> by Shirley Jackson (1962)</b><br> Long overlooked, Jackson&#x2019;s masterpiece has been rediscovered in the twenty-first century by writers from Stephen King and Jonathan Lethem to Joyce Carol Oates. A perfectly constructed and spine-chilling example of the female gothic, the novel was among the first great stories of the weird girl, part teenage outcast, part witch, as a dark heroine of American horror.</li><p></p> <p></p><li><b><i>The Shadow Knows</i> by Diane Johnson (1974)</b><br> While Diane Johnson&#x2019;s novels about Americans in Paris (such as <i>Le Divorce</i>) have been bestsellers, <i>The Shadow Knows</i> is my favorite among her books. Set in Northern California in the early 1970s, it is about the racial conflict and paranoia of the decade, and, in Johnson&#x2019;s words, &#x201c;about persons on the fringe; they happen to be women, and what happens to them is meant to be particular to America in the seventies.&#x201d; </li><p></p> <p></p><li><b><i>Housekeeping</i> by Marilynne Robinson (1980)</b><br> In her first novel, Pulitzer-Prize winning writer Robinson traced the lives of three generations of women in the imaginary Idaho town of Fingerbone, which is surrounded by mountains and next to a dark lake. The narrator, Ruth, and her sister, Lucille, are passed from one family caregiver to another; finally, their aunt Sylvie Fisher, a wanderer and transient, comes back to keep house for them. But Sylvie&#x2019;s bizarre housekeeping is like something out of a gothic fairy tale, and the sisters find their separate ways to create their own domestic visions. </li><p></p> <p></p><li><b><i>Mona in the Promised Land</i> by Gish Jen (1996)</b><br> Gish Jen is one of the funniest and most free-wheeling novelists of the multicultural 90s. In <i>Mona in the Promised Land</i>, whose title plays off a long tradition of Jewish-American immigrant writing, the adolescent Chinese-American heroine Mona Chang is at a new stage of ethnic identity, renaming and self-creation. In their own enclave, she and her high school friends exchange food, music, games, and politics. In the promised land, American girls can change their names, their religions, even re-invent their nationalities. </li><p></p>Elaine Showalter, a professor emerita at Princeton University, is the author of numerous books, including the groundbreaking <i>A Literature of Their Own: British Women Novelists from Bront� to Lessing.</i> A frequent radio and TV commentator in the United Kingdom, she has chaired the Man Booker International prize jury and judged the National Book Awards and the Orange Prize. She divides her time between Washington, D.C., and London.</p><h2>Unfair: The New Science of Criminal Injustice</h2><p><b>"<b>A law professor sounds an explosive alarm on the hidden unfairness of our legal system." <b>&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews,&nbsp;</i>starred</b><br></b>&nbsp;</b><br> A child is gunned down by a police officer; an investigator ignores critical clues in a case; an innocent man confesses to a crime he did not commit; a jury acquits a killer. The evidence is all around us: Our system of justice is fundamentally broken. <br> &nbsp;<br> But it&#x2019;s not for the reasons we tend to think, as law professor Adam Benforado argues in this eye-opening, galvanizing book. Even if the system operated exactly as it was designed to, we would still end up with wrongful convictions, trampled rights, and unequal treatment. This is because the roots of injustice lie not inside the dark hearts of racist police officers or dishonest prosecutors, but within the minds of each and every one of us.<br> &nbsp;<br> This is difficult to accept. Our nation is founded on the idea that the law is impartial, that legal cases are won or lost on the basis of evidence, careful reasoning and nuanced argument. But they may, in fact, turn on the camera angle of a defendant&#x2019;s taped confession, the number of photos in a mug shot book, or a simple word choice during a cross-examination. In <i>Unfair</i>, Benforado shines a light on this troubling new field of research, showing, for example, that people with certain facial features receive longer sentences and that judges are far more likely to grant parole first thing in the morning. <br> &nbsp;<br> Over the last two decades, psychologists and neuroscientists have uncovered many cognitive forces that operate beyond our conscious awareness. Until we address these hidden biases head-on, Benforado argues, the social inequality we see now will only widen, as powerful players and institutions find ways to exploit the weaknesses of our legal system.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> Weaving together historical examples, scientific studies, and compelling court cases&#x2014;from the border collie put on trial in Kentucky to the five teenagers who falsely confessed in the Central Park Jogger case&#x2014;Benforado shows how our judicial processes fail to uphold our values and protect society&#x2019;s weakest members. With clarity and passion, he lays out the scope of the legal system&#x2019;s dysfunction and proposes a wealth of practical reforms that could prevent injustice and help us achieve true fairness and equality before the law.</p><p><b>Adam Benforado</b> is an associate professor of law at Drexel University. A graduate of Yale College and Harvard Law School, he served as a federal appellate law clerk and an attorney at Jenner &amp; Block.

With compassion, insight, and illuminating example, he explains the three stages of forgiveness, shows why we should forgive and whom we should forgive, explains how faith can help us find the strength to forgive, and demonstrates the steps we must take in order to forgive.</p><p>When a heinous act is committed, sometimes one wonders if forgiveness is even possible. Lewis B. Smedes would certainly advise it. "When we forgive," he says, "we set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner we set free is us." In an easy-to-read yet astute analysis of the meaning and value of forgiveness, Smedes teaches the reader that more than anything, forgiveness is a way of healing. He takes as his model the Judeo-Christian God and outlines the many subtleties involved in forgiveness, such as distinguishing anger from hate, and noting that we only forgive those we blame (including ourselves). Forgetting may be more difficult, but at least <i>The Art of Forgiving</i> can help us along the path toward release and healing.We all know the right thing to do is usually the harder thing to do. I am continuing to struggle with forgiving and moving past conflict. I know that bitterness and anger taint my day to day existence, so why hold on to them? What or whose purpose does it serve? I&#39;m not at the point where I could forgive the murderer of a loved one, but I strongly suggest to everyone reading this that you give up a lot of the hostility you carry around from petty disagreements with friends and colleagues. It really will make a difference in how you&#39;ll feel about yourself.</p><h2>Grey Seas Under</h2><p>One of the great storytellers of our century writes passionately of the courage of men and of a small, ocean-going salvage tug, Foundation Franklin.&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain and the crew were mostly Newfounders; the sea was in their blood.&nbsp;&nbsp;Battered by towering waves, dwarfed by the ships she towed, blasted by gale-force winds and frozen by squalls of snow and rain, the stout ship and her brave crew saved hundreds of vessels and thousands of lives as they battled their ancient enemy, the North Atlantic.</p><p>"Recognized as a first-rate saga of the sea."--<i>Montreal Gazette</i>.<p>"Handled with boldness and ingenuity. . .should entrance even the most confirmed landlubber."--<i>Toronto Star</i>.</p><p>"Farley Mowat writes as a good helmsman steers--with easy skill, admirable precision, and the authority of a sailor in his element."--Nicholas Monsarrat</p><b>Farley Mowat</b> was born in Belleville, Ontario, in 1921, and grew up in Belleville, Trenton, Windsor, Saskatoon, Toronto, and Richmond Hill. He served in World War II from 1940 until 1945, entering the army as a private and emerging with the rank of captain. He began writing for his living in 1949 after spending two years in the Arctic. Since 1949 he has lived in or visited almost every part of Canada and many other lands, including the distant regions of Siberia. He remains an inveterate traveller with a passion for remote places and peoples. He has twenty-five books to his name, which have been published in translations in over twenty languages in more than sixty countries. They include such internationally known works as <i>People of the Deer</i>, <i>The Dog Who Wouldn&#x2019;t Be</i>, <i>Never Cry Wolf</i>, <i>Westviking</i>, <i>The Boat Who Wouldn&#x2019;t Float</i>, <i>Sibir</i>, <i>A Whale for the Killing</i>, <i>The Snow Walker</i>, <i>And No Birds Sang</i>, and <i>Virunga: The Passion of Dian Fossey</i>.

E. Housman (Wordsworth Poetry Library)</h2><p>Housman&#39;s melodic and memorable poems have been popular for over a century. He writes typically of lost love, of the brevity of happiness, of young soldiers doomed to die. Admirers have found his work elegant and resonant; detractors have thought much of it mannered and glib. But Housman speaks with two voices: the smooth texts conceal a dark sub-text. This tormented and secretive man wrote poems alive with indirect self-disclosure.</p><p></p><h2>Whirligig</h2><p>Brent Bishop longs to have the popular Brianna strolling around school on his arm. But when she rejects him at a classmate's party, Brent's hopes for popularity are instantly shattered. Devastated, he tries to destroy himself in a car crash... but instead kills an innocent girl named Lea.<br><br>Instead of sending him to jail, Lea's parents challenge Brent to create four whirligigs modeled on a picture of Lea and position them at the four corners of the United States. Lea's mother hopes that the whirligig that used to delight Lea will be a fitting memorial for her precious daughter. She sends Brent off with an unlimited bus ticket, a few pieces of wood, and the tools to memorialize Lea. On his mission to preserve his victim's memory, Brent ultimately rediscovers his own love of life.</p><p><p><b>Paul Fleischman</b> won a Newbery Medal for <i>Joyful Noise</i> and a Newbery Honor for <i>Graven Images</i>. He is also the author of the young adult novel <i>The Mind's Eye</i>, and middle-grade novels including <i>Bull Run</i> and <i>Seedfolks</i>. He lives with his wife in northern California.</p>The day's first squirt of sunlight hit the window. The bus changed gears. Brent opened his eyes. They were climbing through mountains now. The other passengers around him were sleeping. Twitched alert by the light, he craned his neck to get a better view, pressed his head to the tinted glass, and raptly observed the sun's rising. After night came another day. And after death another life. Mornings seemed mysterious gifts. He inspected the dawn with fascination.<br><br>The bus's gears growled. Behind him he heard a faint conversation in another language. This is the afterlife, he told himself. To be crowded in with a collection of strangers, plunging through a foreign landscape, headed toward an unknown destiny. The bus was his ferry across the river Styx. It descended now into an unlit valley. Brent squinted at his map and realized he was in the Cascades. Seattle wasn't far off. He'd been riding for two days, watching new souls board in Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Fargo, Bozeman, Butte, Coeur d'Alene, Spokane. He'd speculated on their previous lives. He had surprisingly little interest in his own. His second life had eclipsed his first. Its moment of birth had been the crash.<br><br>He didn't remember the actual impact. He did recall the ambulance lights, the policeman asking how he felt, the discovery that he'd escaped with only cuts and a minor head injury. Then came the alcohol test. Then the drive to the police station, being booked for drunk driving, the photographs and fingerprints--registering his new birth, he thought now. Then the realization that the ambulance at the scene had been tending someone else, that he'd hit another car. His father had arrived at the station. There was talk of the Chevy, its back end mangled, the car probably totaled. Then the news, delivered by one of the officers, that the woman he'd hit had died.<br><br>The muteness had begun in that moment. He spoke not at all driving home with his father, slept fourteen hours, and didn't speak the next day. He remembered the party and that he'd tried to kill himself. That he'd ended up killing someone else left him frozen, numb from scalp to soles. Words returned on the second day. His turmoil, though, wasn't translatable into words.<br><br>His mother got rid of the newspaper that had a story about the crash, but Brent dug it out of the bottom of the trash can. His car had apparently hit the divider, spun, then been struck by the driver behind him. His blood alcohol was 11. The story was brief and gave only the victim's name, age, and residence: Lea Zamora, 18, Chicago. He plumbed those few facts. She was nearly his own age. He was determined to know more. He tried the obituaries, but her name wasn't listed. He rummaged through the trash for the following day's paper, turned to the gravy-stained obituaries--and found her. Daughter of Cesar and Tamara Zamora, senior at Niles North High School, an honor student, member of the student council, the orchestra, the track team, active in the Filipino community, volunteer at Resurrection Hospital. Why did he have to kill someone like that? Then he realized with a surge of relief that he could perhaps go to the funeral. The police had confiscated his license, but he could take a cab, stand in the back, leave an anonymous offering of some kind. He checked the paper. It had been held the day before.<br><br>He ate little, spoke little, and no longer listened to music. He turned seventeen, an event he scarcely noticed. He heard his parents whisper about the blow to his head and his personality change. He'd been diagnosed with a mild concussion. The headaches, like a wrecking ball working on his skull, came less often, replaced by the endless tolling in his mind of the word <i>murderer.</i> Everyone knew. He refused to go to school and made arrangemeets to finish his classwork at home. He disliked being seen in his neighborhood, where the glances he drew were too long or too short. Among strangers he felt no less an outcast, their blind assumption that he was one of them making him wince inside. He studied their carefree innocence with envy: an old woman reading on a bench in a mall, a baby sleeping in a stroller, a pretzel seller joking with a customer. He was no longer of their kind and never would be.<br><br>There was a hearing with a judge soon after the crash. Like a ghost, Brent listened to other people discuss the accident and his fate. He was charged with DUI and manslaughter. He hadn't contested his guilt; his punishment was the issue at hand. The judge asked for more information and set a date for a second hearing. It was then that the interviewing began. Social workers and psychologists questioned him, his parents, his friends. He found the fact that he'd tried to kill himself impossible to share with another soul. He could scarcely believe he'd actually tried it and wondered how he could have given no thought to the other cars he would hit. His parents hired their own lawyer and a psychologist. Their job was to argue that sending him to the juvenile detention center would be detrimental to his worrisome mental state. His father tried to cheer him up, promising he would serve no time, telling him to put it behind him, assuring him people would forget.<br><br>"I won't," Brent answered silently. He took the obituary from its hiding place, looked up Cesar Zamora in the phone book, and spent all of one day composing what became a four-sentence apology. He mailed it on a Monday. The reply came on Friday--an envelope with his own letter inside, mutilated with scissors, stabbed, defaced with cigarette burns.<br><br>Nightmares about Mr. Zamora stalking him through the Philippine jungle joined those about the detention center. Entering the courthouse for his second hearing, the latest dream of being beaten by a circle of inmates recurred to him. He passed a young man, his arms swarming with tattoos, whom he was certain he'd seen in the dream. He and his parents found their room. The psychologists spoke, then the lawyers. Brent suddenly wondered if Mr. Zamora might be there. He was trying to scan the faces to his rear when his father squeezed his forearm. The judge was addressing him, sentencing him to probation in place of the detention center. His parents beamed. He felt relief, but also an unanswered hunger. He realized he wanted a punishment. Brent knew also that, grim as the detention center might be, he'd have welcomed the chance to leave his family and his previous life behind. The listing of the terms of his probation hardly registered with him--alcohol counseling, therapy for depression, volunteering in an emergency room. Then the judge came to the final item: meeting with the victim's family, if they desired, to discuss restitution.<br><br>Brent knew the meeting would never take place, an outcome that once again left him both relieved and unsatisfied. He wanted to do something for the family. Two days later the probation officer called. The victim's mother had agreed to talk with him.<br><br>The meeting was scheduled in a building downtown. Entering, Brent wished his parents weren't with him. The room was spacious and had a view of Lake Michigan. Miss Gill, young and black and soft-voiced, was there to serve as mediator. A few minutes later Mrs. Zamora arrived, not the tiny Asian woman Brent had pictured but a heavyset redhead in an India print skirt. Among the dozen necklaces jangling on her chest, Brent picked out pendants of an astrological sign and a Native American sun symbol. Her wavy hair flowed exuberantly over her shoulders; the rest of her seemed only half-alive. She navigated the introductions with an eerie, ethereal calm. Brent gazed openly into her face, offering himself up to her, and noticed that her eyes were slightly bloodshot. Those eyes searched his own, then released him. How strange, he thought, that he'd somehow caused this woman, whom he'd never met, to cry.<br><br>"We're meeting today," said Miss Gill, "to apologize, and to understand, and to atone." Her voice was hopeful rather than accusing. "We never know all the consequences of our acts. They reach into places we can't see. And into the future, where no one can."<br><br>She looked at Brent, then invited Mrs. Zamora to describe the results of Lea's death.<br>"When the phone rang," she began, "I was sorting through lentils, to soak for soup the next day." Her voice had a faint flutter to it. Eyes down, she continued her detailed, dispassionate account of that night and the days that followed, of her husband's smashing a wooden chair in his rage, the younger children's endless crying, her sleeplessness, the thought of killing herself to be with Lea, the voice from Lea's photo saying, "No."<br><br>Brent closed his eyes. What murderous machine had he constructed and set in motion? When his turn finally came to speak, the long apology he'd rehearsed reduced itself to the two words "I'm sorry," words he spoke over and over, then wailed miserably through tears, not caring that his parents were watching.<br><br>Miss Gill spoke for a while. When it came time to discuss restitution, Brent saw his father shift nervously. The Zamoras hadn't sued; apparently they were content with the insurance company's payment. His father had brought his checkbook just in case. Brent spied the silver pen beside it in his jacket's inside pocket, stationed like a butler awaiting command. Miss Gill reviewed various possibilities: a written apology to each family member, service to a charity of the Zamoras' choice, service to the Zamoras themselves. Whatever it might be would have to be agreeable to both parties.<br><br>Mrs. Zamora stared back at her. "I don't believe in retribution. Lea was born in the Philippines. I was teaching English and met my husband there. I saw what an-eye-for-an-eye looks like, with the rebels fighting the government and all that. My husband feels a little differently. I also believe everything happens for a reason." She toyed with her necklaces. "That the universe required this. For some reason."<br><br>She paused, then directed her words at...</p><h2>The South Beach Diet: The Delicious, Doctor-Designed, Foolproof Plan for Fast and Healthy Weight Loss</h2><p><p>For years, cardiologist Arthur Agatston, M.D., urged his patients to lose weight for the sake of their hearts, but every diet was too hard to follow or its restrictions were too harsh. Some were downright dangerous. Nobody seemed to be able to stick with low-fat regimens for any length of time. And a diet is useless if you can't stick with it.</p><p>So Dr. Agatston developed his own. The South Beach Diet isn't complicated, and it doesn't require that you go hungry. You'll enjoy normal-size helpings of meat, poultry, and fish. You'll also eat eggs, cheese, nuts, and vegetables. Snacks are required. You'll learn to avoid the bad carbs, like white flour, white sugar, and baked potatoes. Best of all, as you lose weight, you'll lose that stubborn belly fat <i>first</i>!</p><p>Dr. Agatston's diet has produced consistently dramatic results (8 to 13 pounds lost in the first 2 weeks!) and has become a media sensation in South Florida. Now, you, too, can join the ranks of the fit and fabulous with <i>The South Beach Diet</i>.</p></p><p>The verdict is in: those simple carbs we've been living on are killing us. For good health, we've got to get our blood sugar under control and stop the incessant cravings. Or so says Dr. Arthur Agatston, author of <i>The South Beach Diet</i>. The first half of the book details the science behind the diet. Most of the explanations revolve around why things you thought were healthy&#x2014;-orange juice, wheat toast, carrots&#x2014;-are actually evil. To avoid blood sugar surges, Agatston created a modified carbohydrate plan, recommending plenty of high-fiber foods, lean proteins, and healthy fats, while cutting bread, rice, pastas, and fruits. Major differences from other diets include a lack of concern over portion size and a serious indifference to exercise. Feeling full while on a diet is a beautiful thing, but it seems odd that a cardiologist buries his exercise recommendations in a solitary sentence. <p></p><p> The last half of the book covers his three-stage plan; daily diets are mixed with recipes, some of which are from South Beach restaurant chefs. The most restrictive period lasts just two weeks, enough time to stabilize your urges and lose a few pounds; stage two adds fruits and a handful of other carbs, while stage three is meant to last the remainder of your life, with occasional lapses for white bread or birthday cake. While the diet is sound, the book could be better organized. The first half mixes scientific study with anecdote in a seemingly random way, while the mix of meal plans and recipes can be confusing. Still, the recipes are varied and tasty, and you'll never feel deprived, unless you currently happen to live by bread alone. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p><p><b>THE DIET EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT!</b></p><p>Developed by noted Miami cardiologist Dr. Arthur Agatston for his patients, THE SOUTH BEACH DIET became a national phenomenon-because it works. It's not low fat. It's not low carbs. It teaches you to use the right carbs and the right fats to change your body chemistry to burn fat, help reduce your cholesterol, and help prevent metabolic syndrome (pre-diabetes). As a result, you'll lose weight quickly and safely. </p><p>Dr. Agatston's plan allows you to eat the foods you love-meat and fish, cheese, healthy oils and nuts, vegetables, and the right carbohydrates and sweets. There's no mandatory exercise, and you're never left craving more food. Structured in three simple phases, this may be the easiest diet that you've ever tried.</p><p><b>PHASE ONE:</b> Say goodbye to bad-for-you "goodies"! <br>Your cravings will disappear...and so will eight to thirteen pound.</p><p><b>PHASE TWO:</b> Your stomach is visibly smaller and favorite foods are back on the menu!<br>Your body is burning calories, not storing them! </p><p><b>PHASE THREE: </b>The stage that lasts the rest of your life-normal foods in normal portions.<br>You will keep your ideal weight...and maintain your health and vitality.</p><p><b>With recipes and meal plans for each phase!</b></p><p><b>"The real value of the book is its sound nutritional advice."</b><br><b>-<i>Newsweek</i></b></p></p><h2>A Taste of India</h2><p>Take a culinary tour of India.

In spite of the fact that this succinct history of the sweat lodge is written in Bruchac's characteristically simplistic style, it will hold the interest of adult readers. Bruchac presents a thrifty and cogent explanation of the function and role of sweat lodges both historically and in the present. Sweat lodges are part of nearly every native North American culture and have always played an important role in rituals of healing, preparation, and prayer. Bruchac discusses the repression of "sweats," first by the Spaniards and later by the U.S. government, and notes the hypocrisy of these bans, since saunas and other therapeutic steam baths were popular across Europe for centuries. It is with considerable irony that Bruchac then describes the current fad for sweat lodges among non-Indians, particularly in the men's movement. To deepen our understanding of the significance of sweat lodges within Native American cultures, Bruchac shares 25 relevant traditional tales from the Lakota, Blackfeet, Nez Perce, Seneca, Navajo, Hopi, Huron, and others. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>The Lost Prince (Puffin Classics)</h2><p>Marco Loristan, exiled with his father from war-torn Samavia, meets a London street urchin who leads him into political intrigue</p><p>Frances Eliza Hodgson Burnett (24 November 1849 &#x2013; 29 October 1924) was an English-American novelist and playwright. She is best known for the three children's novels Little Lord Fauntleroy (published in 1885&#x2013;1886), A Little Princess (1905), and The Secret Garden (1911). Frances Eliza Hodgson was born in Cheetham, England. After her father died in 1852, the family fell on straitened circumstances and in 1865 immigrated to the United States, settling near Knoxville, Tennessee. There Frances began writing to help earn money for the family, publishing stories in magazines from the age of 19. In 1870, her mother died, and in 1872 Frances married Swan Burnett, who became a medical doctor. The Burnetts lived for two years in Paris, where their two sons were born, before returning to the United States to live in Washington, D.C., Burnett then began to write novels, the first of which (That Lass o' Lowrie's), was published to good reviews. Little Lord Fauntleroy was published in 1886 and made her a popular writer of children's fiction, although her romantic adult novels written in the 1890s were also popular. She wrote and helped to produce stage versions of Little Lord Fauntleroy and A Little Princess. Burnett enjoyed socializing and lived a lavish lifestyle. Beginning in the 1880s, she began to travel to England frequently and in the 1890s bought a home there where she wrote The Secret Garden. Her oldest son, Lionel, died of tuberculosis in 1890, which caused a relapse of the depression she had struggled with for much of her life. She divorced Swan Burnett in 1898, married Stephen Townsend in 1900, and divorced him in 1902. A few years later she settled in Nassau County, Long Island, where she died in 1924 and is buried in Roslyn Cemetery. In 1936 a memorial sculpture by Bessie Potter Vonnoh was erected in her honour in Central Park's Conservatory Garden. The statue depicts her two famous Secret Garden characters, Mary and Dickon.</p><h2>The Thirteenth Candle</h2><p>The Thirteenth Candle?&#39; Well, it is meant to be a logical title derived from what I am trying to do.

But at thirty-five, she traded in her badge for the stability of marriage and motherhood. Now Corie is married to the brilliant and remarkably handsome Judge Josh Geller and is the adoptive mother of his lovely 14-year-old daughter. Between cooking meals and playing chauffeur, Corie scouts Arabic fiction for a few literary agencies and, on Wednesdays, has lunch with her fellow Shorehaven freelancers at a so-so French restaurant. Life is, as they say, <i>fine</i>.<br><p>But at her weekly lunches, Corie senses that something's off. Pete Delaney, a milquetoast package designer, always shows up early, sits in the same spot (often with a different phone in hand), and keeps one eye on the Jeep he parks in the lot across the street. Corie intuitively feels that Pete is hiding something&#x2015;and as someone who is accustomed to keeping her FBI past from her new neighbors, she should know. But does Pete really have a shady alternate life, or is Corie just imagining things, desperate to add some spark to her humdrum suburban existence? She decides that the only way to find out is to dust off her FBI toolkit and take a deep dive into Pete Delaney&#x2019;s affairs.<br></p><p>Always sassy, smart, and wickedly witty, Susan Isaacs is at her formidable best in a novel that is both bitingly wry and ominously thrilling.</p></p><p>Susan Isaacs is the author of thirteen novels, including <i>As Husbands Go</i>, <i>Long Time No See</i>, <i>Any Place I Hang My Hat</i> and <i>Compromising Positions</i>.

Two opposing political philosophies. Two radically different visions for America. <br><br>Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton were without question two of the most important Founding Fathers. They were also the fiercest of rivals. Of these two political titans, it is Jefferson&#x2014;&#x2013;the revered author of the Declaration of Independence and our third president&#x2014;&#x2013;who is better remembered today. But in fact it is Hamilton&#x2019;s political legacy that has triumphed&#x2014;&#x2013;a legacy that has subverted the Constitution and transformed the federal government into the very leviathan state that our forefathers fought against in the American Revolution.<br><br>How did we go from the Jeffersonian ideal of limited government to the bloated imperialist system of Hamilton&#x2019;s design? Acclaimed economic historian Thomas J. DiLorenzo provides the troubling answer in <i>Hamilton&#x2019;s Curse</i>.<br><br>DiLorenzo reveals how Hamilton, first as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention and later as the nation&#x2019;s first and most influential treasury secretary, masterfully promoted an agenda of nationalist glory and interventionist economics&#x2014;&#x2013;core beliefs that did not die with Hamilton in his fatal duel with Aaron Burr. Carried on through his political heirs, the Hamiltonian legacy:<br><br>� Wrested control into the hands of the federal government by inventing the myth of the Constitution&#x2019;s &#x201c;implied powers&#x201d; <br>� Established the imperial presidency (Hamilton himself proposed a permanent president&#x2014;&#x2013;in other words, a king)<br>� Devised a national banking system that imposes boom-and-bust cycles on the American economy<br>� Saddled Americans with a massive national debt and oppressive taxation<br>� Inflated the role of the federal courts in order to eviscerate individual liberties and state sovereignty<br>� Pushed economic policies that lined the pockets of the wealthy and created a government system built on graft, spoils, and patronage<br>� Transformed state governments from Jeffersonian bulwarks of liberty to beggars for federal crumbs<br><br>By debunking the Hamiltonian myths perpetuated in recent admiring biographies, DiLorenzo exposes an uncomfortable truth: The American people are no longer the masters of their government but its servants. Only by restoring a system based on Jeffersonian ideals can Hamilton&#x2019;s curse be lifted, at last.</p><p><b>THOMAS J.

Because of a preternatural inaptitude for mathematics, he had failed to receive a college degree from the University of North Carolina and suffered the added misfortune of arriving in the big city at the moment of the stock market crash. For the next eight years, except for a brief period when he got sick of the whole business and went to sea on a freighter to Leningrad, Joseph Mitchell worked first at <i>The World</i>, then as a district man at <i>The Herald Tribune</i>, and then as a reporter and feature writer at <i>The World-Telegram</i>. He covered the criminal courts, Tammany Hall politicians, major murder trials, and the Lindbergh kidnapping. He wrote multi-part profiles of notable figures of the day, among them Eleanor Roosevelt, George Bernard Shaw, and Franz Boas. His byline, appearing two or three times a day in<i> The World-Telegram</i>, would become familiar to almost four hundred thousand readers. But Mitchell discovered that it was not the politicians, business leaders, or noted celebrities of the day that he got the most pleasure out of interviewing, but people whose talk was &#x201c;artless, the talk of the people trying to reassure or comfort themselves . . . talking to combat the loneliness everyone feels.&#x201d; He began to frequent gymnasiums, speakeasies, and burlesque houses. He visited storefront churches in Harlem, covered the waterfront, and spent time at the Fulton Fish Market. Fascinated by the bizarre and the strange, he would become, in the words of Stanley Walker, his noted editor at <i>The Herald Tribune</i>, &#x201c;one of the best newspaper reporters in the city.&#x201d; In January 1938, <b>My Ears Are Bent</b>, a collection of Mitchell&#x2019;s newspaper pieces, was published. That book, unavailable for more than sixty years, is now restored to print. A few months after the book&#x2019;s original publication, Mitchell joined the staff of <i>The New Yorker</i>, where he remained until his death in 1996.</p><p>From the original reviews of <br><b>My Ears Are Bent</b><br><br>&#x201c;Every Joseph Mitchell story I have ever read has been&#x2014;in its own way&#x2014;a work of art, a fact of which the author is doubtless perfectly unaware. . . . <i>My Ears Are Bent</i> is the saga of sideshow New York written by the angel of the odd or the imp of the perverse, as you prefer.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;Clifton Fadiman, <i>The New Yorker</i><br><br>&#x201c;[In <i>My Ears Are Bent</i>] Mitchell covers several dozen new angles in the life of metropolitan New York, from freak <br>to human interest, from behind the lines on headline sensations to strippers, reefer smokers, the life of a bar and grill. In doing it he has a perfect talent for hitting off the human equation.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Otis Ferguson, <i>The New Republic</i><br><br>&#x201c;These stories, the tales of the people he has talked to in the course of his wanderings about New York, are done with a sharp eye for the revealing detail, and in a prose style that is casual, but tough.

Troubled by visions of monsters fought and of those to come, Buffy must sacrifice herself for Dawn, and her death takes a toll on the Scooby Gang. Without their Slayer, these close friends must band together and confront demons, reptilian sorcerers, and crazed forest creatures in stories written by Amber (Tara) Benson, acclaimed Buffy novelist Christopher Golden, and TV writer Jane Espenson, who presents the secret Season Six rendezvous between Buffy and Angel through the imaginations of the Slayer&#39;s closest friends.

During the 1967 Arab-Israeli conflict, Bellow served as a war correspondent for <i>Newsday</i>. He taught at New York University, Princeton, and the University of Minnesota and was chairman of the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago.<br><br>''Family fiction and the fiction-of-ideas: these are the two competing concerns in Bellow's recent work -- with the combination at its most problematic in his last novel, <i>The Dean's December</i>. Here, however, in five shorter works from the past decade, those seemingly contradictory roles -- the darkly comic memoirist, the thorny essayist -- are on more rewarding display, occasionally even blending in a richly charming way...This welcome gathering presents the restless Bellow voice in full cry -- taut, colorful, Talmudic, and large-hearted.'' --<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> (starred review)<br><br> ''[Bellow] is one of the most gifted chroniclers of the Western world.'' --<i>Times</i> (London), praise for the author<br><br> ''The backbone of twentieth-century American literature has been provided by two novelists -- William Faulkner and Saul Bellow.'' --Philip Roth, Pulitzer Prize-winning author, praise for the author<br><br> ''Sharp, erudite, beautifully measured...[Bellow] is one of the most gifted chroniclers of the Western world.'' --<i>Times</i> (London), praise for the author<br><br> ''If the soul is the mind at its purest, best, clearest, busiest, profoundest, then Bellow's charge has been to restore the soul to American literature.'' --<i>New York Times</i>, praise for the author</p><h2>Cat&#39;s Cradle (Penguin Modern Classics)</h2><p>With his trademark dry wit, Kurt Vonnegut&#39;s Cat&#39;s Cradle is an inventive science fiction satire that preys on our deepest fears of witnessing Armageddon - and, worse still, surviving it.</p><p><b>Cat's Cradle</b>, one of Vonnegut's most entertaining novels, is filled with scientists and G-men and even ordinary folks caught up in the game. These assorted characters chase each other around in search of the world's most important and dangerous substance, a new form of ice that freezes at room temperature. At one time, this novel could probably be found on the bookshelf of every college kid in America; it's still a fabulous read and a great place to start if you're young enough to have missed the first Vonnegut craze.6 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Eye Yoga - How You See is How You Think</h2><p>Many of us are looking for ways to maintain and even improve our vision.

I was working at a pizza-delivery chain and had been assigned garbage duty. While tossing bags into a Dumpster, I heard a faint meow. I began digging through the trash, and several layers down I found a cat&#x2014;bruised and thin. I wasn&#x2019;t sure if the cat had crawled into the Dumpster to scavenge for food or if he had been put there purposely. Our establishment sat directly behind an apartment complex, and unsupervised and abandoned pets were common.</p> <p>Back on solid ground, it became evident that the cat had an injured leg. He couldn&#x2019;t put any weight on his right hindquarters. The situation created a dilemma for me. Finances were tight, and I was moving back home to my parents&#x2019; house&#x2014;with two cats already in tow. Dad barely tolerated the two established felines. His reaction to another injured stray was sure to be less than receptive. I took the stray to the vet, hoping to patch him up. After shots and X-rays, the vet discovered the cat had a cracked pelvis. I posted notices, hoping someone would claim the cat or adopt him.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the response at home was swift and firm: No more cats! Dad insisted I take the cat to the Humane Society immediately. I protested that the cat would be put to sleep. Luckily, my mother intervened. She agreed the injury would make the cat unadoptable, so we would keep him long enough for his hip to heal. Then he would have to go&#x2014;no arguments.</p> <p>Oscar must have somehow understood his situation. He seemed to study the other two cats and their interactions with my father. We suspect he bribed Tanner, our golden retriever, with table scraps in exchange for etiquette lessons. When the other cats were aloof, Oscar was attentive. He came when his name was called, and he would roll over on his back to have his belly scratched. As his injury began to heal, he would jump on the ottoman by my father&#x2019;s favorite chair, and, eventually, into his lap. Initially, Dad pushed Oscar away, but persistence paid off. Soon, Oscar and a muttering Dad shared the chair. At mealtimes, Oscar would come to sit with us.</p> <p>Positioned on the floor by my father&#x2019;s chair, every so often Oscar would reach up with one paw and tap Dad on the knee. At first, this provoked great irritation and colorful expletives expressed in harsh tones. Oscar, however, refused to be put off. Repetitive knee-taps soon led to semi-covert handouts of choice morsels.</p> <p>Oscar greeted my father at the top of the stairs every morning and waited for him at the door every evening. My father sometimes ignored Oscar, and, at other times, stepped over him, complaining the whole time. Oscar mastered opening doors by sticking his paw underneath the door and rocking it back and forth until it opened. Soon, he was sleeping in the master bedroom at the foot of the bed. My father was completely disgusted, but couldn&#x2019;t stop the cat from sneaking onto the bed while they were sleeping. Eventually, Dad gave up.</p> <p>Before long, Oscar, aspiring to his own place at the table during meals, began jumping up into my lap. He was allowed to stay as long as his head remained below table level. Of course, an occasional paw would appear as a reminder of his presence.</p> <p>Three months passed, and the vet pronounced Oscar healthy and healed. I was heartbroken. How could I take this loving soul away from what had become his home, from the people he trusted? Sick at heart, I brought Oscar home and told my parents what should have been good news: Oscar was a healthy cat with a healed hip. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take him to the Humane Society like I promised,&#x201d; I said dully. As I turned to put Oscar in the carrier for the trip, my father spoke, uttering three magic words: &#x201c;Not my cat!&#x201d; Oscar is home to stay. He now has his own chair at the table and sleeps&#x2014;where else?&#x2014;in the master bedroom between my mother and father. He is their official &#x201c;grandkitten&#x201d; and living proof that deep within the most unlikely heart, there is a cat lover in all of us.</p> <p><strong>-Kathleen Kennedy</strong></p> <p>�2005.

The punk rock pin-up cultural phenomenon known as suicidegirls.com includes journal entries excerpted from the site and over 200 artful, color photos.</p></p><p>This collection of glossy shots marks the second birthday of the near-legendary eponymous Web site founded by Missy Suicide (borrowing a little hipster terminology from a Chuck Palahnuik novel in the process) to promote her own pin-up photography, and to make a place where women could "be themselves." The large format book is well designed and finely printed, with over 150 full-color photos of Scarlett, Flux, Fractal and the rest of the pierced, tattooed, leather-'n-lace-lovin' gang. The bulk of the book consists of Missy's portraits of the girls, but a section at the back allows the girls to speak for themselves through diary extracts, their own photos and their answers to questions like "How did you hear about SuicideGirls and what made you want to become one?" As 25-year-old Le from San Francisco puts it, exposing herself in various ways on the internet is both "a hobby and an art form." The S-Girls are spirited, sans doute, and you have to applaud Missy for making such a go of something she loves. But after a while, the tattoos and pierced nipples do tend to blur into something of a sub-Courtney Love mush. (And readers of a certain age won't be able to help wondering if any of these bedroom performance artists have boned up on Lora Logic, Poly Styrene and the much less generic-looking fem-punks of a previous generation.)

Cumming succinctly discusses the subject, technique, symbolism, space and light elements, and historical style of each and adds his personal interpretation. For Hans Holbein's "The Ambassadors," for example, Cumming gives a short biography of the artist, explains the crises in Europe alluded to in the painting, and points out the odd form in the foreground. The latter, he explains, is a distorted death's-head that is meaningless if viewed from the front but from a certain angle takes the shape of a skull.

In 2006 he won a MacArthur &#34;genius&#34; award for his work as a writer, artist, and naturalist. Carroll has been featured on Today (where he reached down into swampy water, miraculously pulled up a turtle he knew, and told her history), in numerous newspapers and magazines, and in the most popular documentary in the history of New Hampshire public television. He is an active lecturer and consultant to conservation institutions throughout New England.In this sensuous nature journal, MacArthur genius award winner Carroll (<i>The Year of the Turtle</i>) follows the inhabitants of his local New Hampshire wetlands through a season of turtle life from March thaw, when the turtles wake from hibernation, to November, when ice puts them back to sleep, along the way celebrating such personal holy days as the Return of the Red-winged Blackbird. Wearing camouflage and waders, he meets wildlife on its own terms. At the sudden appearance of a red doe, he wonders, to have those senses&#x2014;would I trade my thinking, dreaming, imagining mind for them for one full day... would I ever want to come back? He watches a thirsty turtle hatchling encountering water for the first time: he extends his neck full length, immerses his head, closes his eyes and drinks for 21 minutes. Accompanied by Carroll's own exquisite drawings, this poetic recording of his season of loving observation is subdued by Carroll's dread of habitat destruction and nostalgia for a boyhood when I entered waters that, if not alive themselves, were so filled with light and life that my binding with them was as much metaphysical as physical. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Dr. Ian Stevenson, the founder of this work, has always written for a scientific audience. Now, in this provocative and fascinating book, Dr. Jim B. Tucker, a child psychiatrist who currently directs the research, shares these studies with the general public. <i>Life Before Life</i> is a landmark work&#x2014;one that has the potential to challenge and ultimately change our understandings about life and death.<br>Children who report past-life memories typically begin talking spontaneously about a previous life when they are two to three years old. Some talk about the life of a deceased family member, while others describe the life of a stranger. They may recount details about previous family members, events in the previous life, or the way they died in that life. The children tend to show a strong emotional involvement with the apparent memories and often cry to be taken to the previous family. In many cases, parents have taken their children to the places they named, where they found that an individual had died whose life matched the details given by the child. During the visits, some children have recognized family members or friends from that individual&#x2019;s life. Many children have had birthmarks that matched wounds on the body of the deceased individual. <br>Researchers have studied more than 2500 such cases, and their careful investigations have produced an impressive body of work. <i>JAMA</i>, the Journal of the American Medical Association, stated in a review of one of Dr. Stevenson&#x2019;s scientific books that, &#x201c;in regard to reincarnation he has painstakingly and unemotionally collected a detailed series of cases . . . in which the evidence is difficult to explain on any other grounds.&#x201d;<br><i>Life Before Life</i> explores the various features of this world-wide phenomenon, describing numerous cases along the way. We meet a boy in Michigan who, after being born with three birthmarks that matched wounds on his deceased brother, begins talking about events from the brother&#x2019;s life; a boy in Turkey who gives a number of accurate details, including the name, of a man who lived 500 miles away and died fifty years before the boy was born; and a girl in Sri Lanka who is able to recognize the family members of a deceased stranger as they are presented to her one by one, giving specifics about their lives that she could not have known from their appearance. <br>Dr. Tucker presents this material in a straightforward way, relating extraordinary stories that have been amassed with a scientific approach. He then considers how best to interpret the evidence, and he lets readers reach their own conclusions&#x2014;which, for many, will be profound. <br></p><p>JIM B. TUCKER, M.D. is a child psychiatrist at the University of Virginia, where he directs research into children's reports of past-life memories at the Division of Personality Studies and serves as Medical Director of the Child &amp; Family Psychiatry Clinic. <br>"In this very elegant book, Dr. Tucker offers the most convincing scientific evidence for the fact that our consciousness survives physical death.&nbsp; And indeed, takes quantum leaps of creativity in the form of reincarnation.&nbsp; The model that Dr. Tucker presents opens a new vision of who we are, limitless beings that fill up all of space and time."--Deepak Chopra, author of &nbsp;Life After Death: The Burden of Proof&nbsp;"[A][ solid case for reincarnation....

She tells the doll that she and Bruno, her bear, "like digging in dirt and climbing trees. No tea parties, no being pushed around in frilly prams. You'll just have to get used to the way we do things." Much to Charlotte and Bruno's surprise, Dahlia seems to like getting dirty while making mud cakes and racing wagons. But at the end of the day, Charlotte's aunt arrives for a visit and wants to see how Dahlia's doing . . . and Charlotte is in for another surprise. <br><br>Charming, detailed illustrations accompany this sweet story about making room for a new friend. <br></p><p>Barbara McClintock has written and illustrated several books for young readers, including <i>Molly and the Magic Wishbone</i>, about which <i>Booklist</i>, in a starred review, said, "McClintock's telling is well paced and nuanced . . . And, oh, the charm of the pictures. The Dickensian world is fully realized." She lives in New Canaan, Connecticut.<br>In a doll story that will win over even confirmed tomboys, McClintock (Molly and the Magic Wishbone) introduces a Victorian child who, despite her frock and pinafore, enjoys digging in the dirt and climbing trees. After Aunt Edme sends Charlotte a doll dressed "in linen and lace and delicate silk ribbons," the child brings the doll up to her bedroom (home to birds' nests, a bug collection and a pet snake) and lays out the house rules: "No tea parties, no being pushed around in frilly prams. You'll just have to get used to the way we do things." And the doll, whom Charlotte names Dahlia, does just that. She joins the girl and her teddy, Bruno, as they make mud cakes and even tastes one and participates in Bruno's favorite game of "toss-up-in-the-air-and-land-in-a-heap." When Charlotte washes the mud from the doll's face, her "prim" painted mouth "blur[s] into a soft smile." Dahlia even survives a fall from a tree, although her finery gets crumpled and torn. Readers will hold their breath when the child shows her tattered doll to seemingly priggish Aunt Edme, who responds to the beaming Dahlia's condition with a smile of her own. McClintock's detailed tableaux conveying the garb, architecture and furnishings of the era perfectly fit the mood of the story, their delicate lines and coloring belied by the robust action they convey.

The near-meltdown occurred at a pivotal moment when the New Deal coalition was unraveling, trust in government was eroding, conservatives were consolidating their power, and the political left was becoming marginalized. Using the accident to explore this turning point, Natasha Zaretsky provides a fresh interpretation of the era by disclosing how atomic and ecological imaginaries shaped the conservative ascendancy.<br><br>Drawing on the testimony of the men and women who lived in the shadow of the reactor, <i>Radiation Nation</i> shows that the region's citizens, especially its mothers, grew convinced that they had sustained radiological injuries that threatened their reproductive futures. Taking inspiration from the antiwar, environmental, and feminist movements, women at Three Mile Island crafted a homegrown ecological politics that wove together concerns over radiological threats to the body, the struggle over abortion and reproductive rights, and eroding trust in authority. This politics was shaped above all by what Zaretsky calls "biotic nationalism," a new body-centered nationalism that imagined the nation as a living, mortal being and portrayed sickened Americans as evidence of betrayal. The first cultural history of the accident, <i>Radiation Nation</i> reveals the surprising ecological dimensions of post-Vietnam conservatism while showing how growing anxieties surrounding bodily illness infused the political realignment of the 1970s in ways that blurred any easy distinction between left and right.</p><p>On March 28, 1979, the worst nuclear reactor accident in U.S. history occurred at the Three Mile Island power plant. <i>Radiation Nation</i> uses the accident to explore the late 1970s as a turning point, focusing on how women crafted a homegrown ecological politics and a new body-centered nationalism.

In an attempt to explain the world's sixth-most populous nation in under 600 pages, Lieven ranges widely, touching upon everything from the rise and fall of landed families in the Punjab to the sloth of the national police to the garish d�cor in wealthy homes. To this ambitious task the author brings both thoroughness and an impressive familiarity with his subject.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>DAWN.com</i>, August 2, 2011</b>&#x201c;a thought-provoking and widely influential new book&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>DAWN.com</i> September 2, 2011</b><br><br><b><i>IBN Live, </i></b><b>May 19, 2011</b><br> &#x201c;If I had to review the book 'Pakistan: A Hard Country' in one line I would say it is brilliant.

Instead of the too often repeated narrative of Pakistan&#x2019;s history and ills, he offers a broader sweep into the condition of the provinces, the climate, the political parties and their personalities&#x2014;and, in his best chapter, an important discussion of how today&#x2019;s Taliban represent a continuation of similar uprisings a century ago.&nbsp;<b><i>Dallas Morning News</i></b><b>, May 9, 2011</b><br> &#x201c;Since the death of Osama bin Laden&nbsp;in Pakistan last week, it&#x2019;s become increasingly clear that anyone hoping to follow international affairs should perhaps have begun watching that country some time ago. Fortunately, Pakistan: A Hard Country serves as an outstanding primer &#x2014; even reading just the introduction is supremely useful... Lieven crafts a lucid and thoroughly fascinating whole from a wealth of information... Lieven&#x2019;s writing is excellent, especially crucial in a book tackling a topic with which many readers are entirely unfamiliar. Moreover, he clearly loves the place and its people. <i>Pakistan</i><i>: A Hard Country</i> is the work of one of those rare writers able to see his subject in all its complexity, without either turning away or becoming a partisan of one perspective or the other.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br><b><i><br> Evening Standard</i>, April 21, 2011<br></b>&#x201c;The gulf between...the multiple realities most Pakistanis know - and how outsiders perceive their country is wide and deep. Lieven's book is an ambitious and much-needed attempt to bridge it. The most striking thing about the book is its informed and consistently sensible tone. This tone is not heard much in discussions about Pakistan, and it is refreshing. Lieven writes in an affable, conversational voice, but not a casual one. His observations are precise and judicious.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>Financial Times</i>, April 22, 2011</b>&#x201c;Pakistan, as Anatol Lieven explains in this thorough analysis of the internal sources of this resilience, will not disintegrate easily...He deftly tackles the misperception in the west that Islamist groups might easily sweep through Pakistan.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>The Nation</i>, April 13, 2011</b>&#x201c;This book could hardly be timelier. Lucid and well informed, he deals carefully with Pakistan&#x2019;s well-known problems. He raises hope, avoiding the hysteria and partial judgment that disfigure much contemporary writing on the subject. Above all, he emanates a deep affection bordering on love for the unfortunate, beleaguered, magical Pakistan.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br><b><i><br> Economist</i>, April 7, 2011<br></b>"Yet for drama, colour and complexity, [Pakistan] is hard to beat; and Anatol Lieven captures the richness of the place wonderfully.

This insightful, comprehensive portrait of Pakistan is the perfect antidote to stereotypical descriptions of the country as the most dangerous place in the world...

Threaded throughout are the voices of ordinary Pakistanis farmers, politicians, spooks, landowners, businessmen, soldiers, judges, clerics and jihadis whose contributions in the form of direct quotes enliven and illuminate this complex yet affectionate portrait of their country. Published just before bin Laden s death, the book does not read as if it has been overtaken by events. Indeed, its textured, penetrating survey of the dynamics shaping contemporary Pakistan could hardly be more timely, given the relative dearth of literature on the subject. Lieven makes a compelling case for why we should pay more attention to what is one of the most important but least understood countries in the world.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>Small Wars Journal, </i>June 5, 2011</b>&#x201c;Anatol Lieven has written an excellent book...It is perhaps the one book to read on Pakistan in 2011, and offers a level of nuance required for those wanting to become true specialists on the complexity of Pakistan&#x2019;s political history.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><h2>You Can Do It!: The Merit Badge Handbook for Grown-Up Girls</h2><p><i>You Can Do It!</i> is the vision of Lauren Catuzzi Grandcolas, a heroine of United Flight 93 and a woman who was an inspiration to all who knew her.

They tend to come uninvited and unexpected.&#39; In the third of the Elsie Dinsmore: A Life of Faith books, Elsie and her father are together at last and many exciting changes lie ahead. Elsie is growing up, and there are new worlds to explore beyond her Southern home. Old friends will be reunited, and new friends will enter her life. But not everyone has Elsie&#39;s best interests at heart. When unexpected proposals are offered, can Elsie make the right decisions? Is she ready to share her love? Elsie&#39;s New Life continues the captivating stories of the beautiful heiress and the power of her unshakable Christian faith. Based on and adapted from the original novels written by Martha Finley between 1868 and 1905, Elsie&#39;s New Life follows its charming heroine from age eleven to sixteen. Readers will again be enthralled and inspired as each new adventure brings difficult choices for Elsie Dinsmore, the little girl of big faith.</p><p>For girls ages 10-14 ? About 100 years ago, a bright-eyed little girl named Elsie Dinsmore stole the hearts of parents and children around the world. In 28 novels published between 1868 and 1904, Elsie exemplified true biblical faith in the face of adversity--inspiring generations of girls and young women. Now Elsie&#39;s story comes to life again in a completely updated series adapted from the original novels. While faithful to Martha Finley&#39;s stories and characters, these adaptations also meet the needs and interests of contemporary young readers. We first meet Elsie when she is eight years old and living on her grandfather&#39;s plantation in the South. In succeeding novels, she grows up, finds love, marries and has her own children, and eventually becomes a grandmother. Throughout her life, Elsie faces each new challenge--from personal temptations to the tragedies of war and the loss of loved ones--with strength, courage, and trust in the love and guidance of her Heavenly Father. Zondervan is pleased to offer the first four volumes of this timeless series. Although set in a distant time and place, they are as lively, engaging, and relevant as the best of modern Christian juvenile fiction. The Elsie Dinsmore series promises to provide inspiration and encouragement to a new generation of girls.Mission City Press is a Christian publishing company dedicated to teaching kids to live a life of faith with passionate devotion to Jesus Christ.</p><h2>The Essential Wallerstein (New Press Essential)</h2><p>This work draws upon the full range of Wallerstein&#39;s social scientific scholarship, from his groundbreaking research on contemporary African politics and social change, to his study of the modern world-system and current essays on the new structures of knowledge emerging from the crisis of the capitalist world-economy.

When fifteen-year-old Francie finds a note hidden in the stump of an old sequoia, she immediately recognizes her sister's handwriting. But Carrie died in an accident six years ago. Could Carrie's secret still be important? <br> Francie's search for the truth turns dangerous, and she needs to get to St. Joseph fast. She's faced with the choice of either giving up, or riding the flume, a rickety track that carries lumber from the mills in the mountains to the lumberyard in St. Joseph. Should Francie risk her life for the secret her sister fought to keep?</p><p><b>Patricia Curtis Pfitsch</b>&nbsp;lives on a ridge-top farm in southwest Wisconsin with her partner, Jack, their dog, Gaea, and two annoying but lovable cats. They have three grown children, Hollis, Woody, and Jane.

"But I was horrified when I learned that in the 1890s, thousands of sequoias were cut down, even though their wood was so brittle that more than half of the trees shattered when they fell. Why would humans waste the long lives of such beautiful and ancient creatures? In my search for the answer to that question,&nbsp;<i>Riding the Flume</i>&nbsp;was born."Grade 5-8-Between 1890 and 1903, whole forests of giant sequoia trees were felled for lumber in northern California. In this exciting adventure story, Francie, 15, begins to unravel a mystery when she finds a hidden note left by her sister, now deceased, in the hole of a tree and sets out to stop the logging of the biggest giant. Set in 1894, the novel is a fast read, ending with a daredevil ride on the loggers' flume. Francie is a brave, high-spirited teen who values commitment, history, the environment, and the legacy of her sister's memory. A subplot involves the family dealing with the loss of Carrie six years earlier. The uneasy decision between whether to save the tree in memory of Carrie or save the economy and the loggers' jobs is handled objectively. Pfitsch has researched her subject well and gives the California mountain landscape and its inhabitants a note of realism. However, the book is weakened by too simple a resolution, the downplaying of natural hazards in the wild, and many dangers either glossed over or omitted. The writing is sometimes repetitious, but it is easy, making the story an accessible and enjoyable read. Some moral-value issues, such as telling the truth and minding parents, are nicely handled. The attractive jacket depicting the dangerous ride on the flume should draw readers and help sell the book.<br><i>Susannah Price, Boise Public Library, ID</i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Two For The Money</h2><p>Professional thief Nolan must negotiate a truce with the whole Chicago mafia by pulling off one last heist, but when the job goes horribly wrong, Nolan becomes immersed in a deadly world of betrayal where only his desire for revenge can save him.

This time, a body has turned up in a boat on the Thames: Delbert Cathcart, a talented portrait photographer with a taste for blackmail. Clad in a velvet dress, wrists manacled, legs spread grotesquely, skull crushed, Cathcart reminds Pitt of a perverse echo of the Lady of Shalott, or perhaps a debased Ophelia. Which of Cathcart's clients could have been pushed so far as to retaliate in such hideous fashion? </p><p> Pitt's official investigation is usually combined with another more idiosyncratic approach to the crime; this secondary analysis gives Perry free rein to dissect the manners and morals of Victorian society. In <i>Half Moon Street</i>, the genteel inquisition falls to Caroline Fielding, Charlotte's mother (Charlotte, who must need a bit of rest after so many outings, has been packed off to Paris for a vacation; her presence in the book is restricted to letters marveling, rather tediously, at the scandalous iniquities of the Moulin Rouge dance hall). Perry's readers will no doubt remember that Caroline scandalized society by marrying a much younger actor, Joshua. <i>Half Moon Street</i> introduces Caroline to his theatrical world, and to Cecily Antrim, a beautiful actress with liberal politics. Cecily poses both a personal and philosophical threat to Caroline, who is disturbed by her willingness to expose the realities of female sexuality on stage: "Should such things be said? Was there something indecent in the exposure of feelings so intimate? To know it herself was one thing, to realize that others also knew was quite different. It was being publicly naked rather than privately." This fear of exposure resonates through the worlds of theatrical and photographic art, as actors, diplomats, and genteel citizens race to hide their secrets from Pitt and Caroline.</p><p> While Perry evokes the London atmosphere with her usual skill, her narrative lacks its usual finesse. Rather than balancing Pitt's and Caroline's investigation, the novel lurches between them so that it seems all too often that Perry, in pursuit of one story, has forgotten the other. Additionally, Caroline's reaction to feminist politics and sexuality is inexplicably repetitive; her turgid expressions of horror seem the result of an overly eager copy-and-paste procedure. One hopes that this is a momentary lapse in an otherwise solid series. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>"Perry can write a Victorian mystery that would make Dickens's eyes pop."<br>--<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"Intelligently written and historically fascinating."<br>--<i>The Wall Street Journal</i><br><br>"When it comes to the Victorian mystery . . . nobody does it better."<br>--<i>The San Diego Union Tribune</i><br><br>"Perry has a great gift of making it all seem immediate and very much alive."<br>--<i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i><br></p><h2>The White Stag</h2><p>Retells the legendary story of the Huns and Magyars&#39; long migration from Asia to Europe where they hope to find a permanent home.</p><p>Kate Seredy (1899-1975) is the Hungarian-born writer and illustrator of numerous children&#39;s books.

Carrying a battered suitcase containing several jars of marmalade, and wearing a tag around his neck that read Please Look after This Bear, he stowed away on a ship and landed in Londons Paddington Station. As luck would have it, the Brown family found him, named him Paddington, and welcomed him to their home and into the hearts of millions of readers.Since 1958, Paddington Bear has charmed readers worldwide with his humorous misadventures. In celebration of Paddingtons 40th birthday, Michael Bonds original story of Paddington Bear has been beautifully reillustrated by artist R.W.

His menial Post Office day job supports a life of beer, one-night stands and race tracks. First published in 1971, this was Charles Bukowski&#39;s debut novel.</p><p><p>Charles Bukowski is one of America&#x2019;s best-known contemporary writers of poetry and prose and, many would claim, its most influential and imitated poet. He was born in 1920 in Andernach, Germany, to an American soldier father and a German mother, and brought to the United States at the age of two. He was raised in Los Angeles and lived there for more than fifty years. He died in San Pedro, California, on March 9, 1994, at the age of seventy-three, shortly after completing his last novel, <em>Pulp.</em></p>&#34;An amazing, hilarious and unfalteringly entertaining account of a man trapped in a kind of Catch 23&#34; Sunday Times &#34;Takes you by the shoulders and shakes you until your teeth rattle&#34; The Times &#34;Cunningly, relentlessly jokey and sad&#34; Observer &#34;One of the funniest books ever written&#34; Uncut &#34;Amazing, hilarious and unfalteringly entertaining&#34; --Sunday Times</p><h2>The Dark Tower Dark Tower</h2><p>The final volume sees gunslinger Roland on a roller-coaster mix of exhilarating triumph and aching loss in his unrelenting quest to reach the dark tower. A journey which means he must leave his faithful frineds Eddie, Susannah, Jake, even Oy, as he closes on the Tower. His steps are followed only by Mordred, half-human, half-terrifying creature heir to the Crimson King. In the end, it is an unlikely ally who will hold to key to the Tower itself, centre of all time and all place.</p><p>At one point in this final book of the <i>Dark Tower</i> series, the character Stephen King (added to the plot in <i>Song of Susannah</i>) looks back at the preceding pages and says "when this last book is published, the readers are going to be just wild." And he's not kidding. <p> After a journey through seven books and over 20 years, King's Constant Readers finally have the conclusion they've been both eagerly awaiting and silently dreading. The tension in the <i>Dark Tower</i> series has built steadily from the beginning and, like in the best of King's novels, explodes into a violent, heart-tugging climax as Roland and his <i>ka-tet</i> finally near their goal. The body count in <i>The Dark Tower</i> is high. The gunslingers come out shooting and face a host of enemies, including low men, mutants, vampires, Roland's hideous quasi-offspring Mordred, and the fearsome Crimson King himself. King pushes the gross-out factor at times--Roland's lesson on tanning (no, not sun tanning) is brutal--but the magic of the series remains strong and readers will feel the pull of the Tower as strongly as ever as the story draws to a close. During this sentimental journey, King ties up loose ends left hanging from the 15 non-series novels and stories that are deeply entwined in the fabric of Mid-World through characters like Randall Flagg (The Stand and others) or Father Callahan (<i>'Salem's Lot</i>). When it finally arrives, the long awaited conclusion will leave King's myriad fans satisfied but wishing there were still more to come. </p><p> In King's memoir <i>On Writing</i>, he tells of an old woman who wrote him after reading the early books in the <i>Dark Tower</i> series. She was dying, she said, and didn't expect to see the end of Roland's quest. Could King tell her? Does he reach the Tower? Does he save it? Sadly, King said he did not know himself, that the story was creating itself as it went along. Wherever that woman is now (the clearing at the end of the path, perhaps?), let's hope she has a copy of <i>The Dark Tower</i>. Surely she would agree it's been worth the wait. <i>--Benjamin Reese</i></p>Stephen King is the bestselling author of more than forty books.

Friends they&#x2019;re not; Skipper Gates had led the charge to get Mike fired from his job as a partner in a prestigious law firm.<br><br>But Gates needs Daley now &#x2014; and needs him badly. He&#x2019;s just been arrested. It seems that a couple of hours earlier he woke up in an armchair in his hotel room and found the dead body of a young male prostitute in the bed.<br><br>The details that continue to emerge from the crime scene are tabloid heaven. The SFPD is certain Gates did it. The prosecutors are already talking the death penalty, and there&#x2019;s nothing in the mounting evidence, and certainly not in Gates&#x2019;s unpersuasive denials, to convince Daley and his partner (and ex-wife) Rosie of his innocence. But even if he&#x2019;s lying, it&#x2019;s their job to defend him, and that means finding out what really happened.<br><br>Sure enough, the deeper they dig, the seamier their findings.

Gates claims he fell asleep in front of the television and woke to find the body. But no one is buying this excuse, and the DA is brought up on murder charges by his own office, which plans to seek the death penalty.<p> Michael Daley (defense attorney, ex-priest, and ex-public defender) agrees to take the case, though he has no great affection for the accused. Gates has had his sights set on the attorney general's office, and in San Francisco's political community, it seems everyone has slept with, betrayed, or crushed everyone else. Perhaps Gates's assertion of a vast conspiracy is true. Still, Daley believes Gates is not telling the whole truth about the case. What is he hiding? Daley's search takes him from the elite neighborhoods of San Francisco to the seedy--and deadly--underworld of the Mission District's prostitutes and drug pushers, all the while carrying on a trial that's full of twists and turns. In this follow-up to to Special Circumstances, Sheldon Siegel proves that he's no one-shot wonder.

As Caerphilly County&#x2019;s reigning Mistress of the Revels, I didn&#x2019;t dare let anyone hear me badmouthing Christmas or showing less than the brightest of holiday spirits. I took a deep breath and straightened my holly wreath headdress before saying anything aloud. <br>&#x201c;Could you please tell the drummers and pipers to stop drumming and piping immediately?&#x201d; I fi nally said. Shouted, actually, to be heard above the din. <br>&#x201c;They won&#x2019;t like it, Meg,&#x201d; my brother, Rob, shouted back. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re having a competition to see who can make the most noise.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I never would have guessed,&#x201d; I muttered. But I kept smiling as I said it. And I reminded myself that muttering wasn&#x2019;t particularly inconspicuous in weather so cold your breath smoked. <br>If only someone had warned me beforehand that &#x201c;Mistress of the Revels&#x201d; wasn&#x2019;t an honorary title. It meant I was in charge of organiz ing Caerphilly&#x2019;s annual holiday parade. <br>This year&#x2019;s theme was &#x201c;The Twelve Days of Christmas.&#x201d; The twelve drummers drumming were represented by twelve members of the Caerphilly College fife and drum corps, while the pipers piping were eleven assorted bagpipers&#x2014;currently playing in at least eleven different keys. <br>The drummers outnumbered the pipers, especially since they&#x2019;d also brought along twelve matching fi fers. But the bagpipers seemed quite capable of holding their own in the noise department. They were definitely going to win if this turned into an endurance test. The drummers were already showing signs of fatigue, and the bagpipers hadn&#x2019;t even hit their stride yet. And while &#x201c;Silent Night&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Little Drummer Boy&#x201d; are both lovely Christmas carols when played separately, they didn&#x2019;t work well when played simultaneously by dueling groups of musicians. <br>None of which would have bothered me if they&#x2019;d been doing it farther off&#x2014;say, down in the cow pasture where they&#x2019;d been asked to muster. Why did they insist on hovering right across the street from our house, all too near the spot in our front yard where I&#x2019;d stationed myself, clipboard in hand, to check in the arriving parade participants? <br>&#x201c;Go and tell them&#x2014;&#x201d; I began, and then stopped. Rob looked at me expectantly. He was quite dashing in one of the medieval costumes we&#x2019;d borrowed from the Caerphilly College drama department. The blue brocade tunic matched his eyes, and unlike some of the volunteers, he was skinny enough to get away with wearing tights. As one of the ten lords a-leaping he was going to be a smashing success. <br>But as an enforcer, Rob would be a disaster. I knew what would happen if I sent him over to quell the riotous music. He&#x2019;d ask them politely. They&#x2019;d ignore him&#x2014;if they even heard him. A little later, I&#x2019;d go over to see why they hadn&#x2019;t shut up and fi nd Rob taking bagpiping lessons or practicing his leaping in time with the fife and drums. <br>Some things you have to do yourself. <br>&#x201c;Never mind,&#x201d; I said, as I turned to head in the direction of the musical duel. &#x201c;Go make sure none of the other leaping lords have hopped off anywhere. And can you check the Weather Channel and get the latest prediction on when the snow will start? I&#x2019;m going to&#x2014; damn!&#x201d; <br>I&#x2019;d stepped in something squishy. I remembered that the eight maids a-milking had recently strolled by, leading their eight purebred Holstein milk cows. <br>&#x201c;Please tell me I didn&#x2019;t just step in cow dung.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Okay, you didn&#x2019;t just step in cow dung,&#x201d; Rob said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m pretty sure the cleanup crew has been by at least once since the cows came through here.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a relief,&#x201d; I said. Though I was energetically scraping my foot on the gravel anyway. <br>&#x201c;So that&#x2019;s almost certainly camel dung.&#x201d; <br>As if that made a difference. I lost it, briefl y. <br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t those stupid wise men keep their beastly camels out of the road?&#x201d; I snapped. Rob had turned to go and either didn&#x2019;t hear me or pretended not to. It occurred to me that perhaps I shouldn&#x2019;t be so harsh on the wise men, since Michael Waterston, my husband of six months, was one of them. <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t blame the stupid wise men,&#x201d; came a voice from behind me. &#x201c;It was my fault.&#x201d; <br>I turned around to see an enormous, bushy-bearded figure clad in a peculiar feathered garment. One of the six geese a-laying, I realized&#x2014;I&#x2019;d have recognized that immediately if he&#x2019;d been wearing the goose head and had been waving wings instead of a pair of brawny arms covered with thick hair and a colorful collection of biker- and wildlife-themed tattoos. But never mind the incomplete costume&#x2014;I was just glad to see its wearer. <br>&#x201c;Clarence!&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You made it!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t miss it for the world,&#x201d; he said, giving me a bear hug. <br>&#x201c;So this is one of the six geese a-laying?&#x201d; said a nasal voice with a hint of a Southern drawl. I glanced over to see who was talking and saw a tall, cadaverously thin man in jeans and a faded brown parka. And he wasn&#x2019;t just tall compared to my fi ve feet ten&#x2014;he even looked tall standing beside Clarence, who was six and a half feet tall and almost as wide. <br>Brown parka was scribbling in a pocket notebook. Around his neck he wore a small silver digital camera and a lanyard with a laminated badge. <br>&#x201c;You must be the reporter from The Washington Star- Tribune,&#x201d; I said. <br>&#x201c;Are you&#x2014;&#x201d; he paused to look into his notebook. &#x201c;Meg Lansdowne? The parade organiz er?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Meg Langslow,&#x201d; I corrected. <br>&#x201c;J. Ainsley Werzel,&#x201d; he said. He stuck out a hand and I shook it, somewhat awkwardly, since he was still holding the ballpoint pen in it. <br>&#x201c;So, one of your geese, I presume?&#x201d; he repeated. He stuck his pen behind his ear and grabbed his digital camera, apparently intent on getting a festive holiday shot of the ferrets inked up and down Clarence&#x2019;s arms. <br>&#x201c;And also one of our vets,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;This is Dr. Clarence Rutledge. He&#x2019;ll be helping look after the welfare of the many live animals appearing in today&#x2019;s parade.&#x201d; <br>I winced inwardly at how stilted I sounded, like something out of a press release from the town council. But better stilted than dimwitted. <br>Clarence shook the reporter&#x2019;s hand with a great deal less caution than I had. He was so used to enduring the teeth and claws of his more recalcitrant patients that a mere ballpoint pen wound meant nothing to him. Werzel was the one who winced. <br>&#x201c;Damn,&#x201d; Werzel said, as he continued to gape at Clarence. &#x201c;I wish my photographer would get here already. You haven&#x2019;t seen him, have you&#x2014;short guy with a big Nikon?&#x201d; <br>I shook my head. <br>&#x201c;Damn,&#x201d; Werzel repeated. &#x201c;He said ten minutes half an hour ago. Ah, well.&#x201d; <br>He stood looking around with an odd expression on his face, as if tracking down the source of a bad smell. I checked my foot again. No, it was clean. And when I took a deep breath, the icy air held only the tantalizing odors of the coffee, cocoa, and spiced cider at a nearby refreshment stand. I could hear sleigh bells jingling in the distance, and strains of Christmas carols drifting from various parts of the yard. A brace of cousins hurried by pushing a cart loaded high with poinsettias, and several small children dressed as elves were handing out candy canes, courtesy of the Caerphilly Candy Shop. What could possibly be causing that sour face? <br>&#x201c;Quaint,&#x201d; Werzel pronounced. <br>&#x201c;Quaint what?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Clearly that&#x2019;s going to have to be my angle on this story. Quaint.&#x201d; <br>He nodded as he said it, and a satisfi ed expression replaced the frown. He couldn&#x2019;t have been here more than five minutes, the parade itself wouldn&#x2019;t start for hours&#x2014;and he&#x2019;d already decided on his angle? <br>&#x201c;Pity I can&#x2019;t think of something more sexy,&#x201d; he said, shaking his head. <br>Not that he&#x2019;d tried. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never really considered Christmas all that sexy,&#x201d; I said aloud. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all a big conspiracy by the stores,&#x201d; he said. <br>I hoped that wasn&#x2019;t going to be the theme of his story. But then, I didn&#x2019;t have high hopes about the story anyway. The Caerphilly Town Council members might have been thrilled when they heard that the Trib wanted to cover our event, but I was far more pessimistic about how much could go wrong today. Not to mention more cynical about how ridiculous an unsympathetic reporter could make us look if he wanted to. <br>And why was the Washington Star- Tribune sending a reporter to cover our parade, anyway? Caerphilly County and the town of Caerphilly were in rural Virginia, two hours south of Washington, D.C., and the Trib rarely mentioned their one claim to fame&#x2014;the small but prestigious college where my husband taught in the drama department. Our parade drew good attendance each year, but mainly from the county itself and from nearby counties even more rural than we were. Why wasn&#x2019;t Werzel covering more glamorous sights closer to home, like the national Christmas tree and whatever holiday parades and festivals the greater metropolitan Washington area had to offer? He could have written a clich�d story about our quaint country parade without leaving his desk. I was convinced Werzel had an ulterior motive&#x2014; to make us look not only quaint but ridiculous.

This is the history of Allen's ``professional adventures in broadcasting, and not a revelation of my experiences as pianist, composer, author, public citizen, lover, husband or father.'' With all this, according to Allen, covered elsewhere, what's left? But sticking simply to his various shows as he faced the radio mike or TV camera allows Allen to skim the cream from 50 years of lightweight chat and comedy routines and keep his reminiscences under tight rein while moving at a gallop. With material groomed to shine, he often comes off better here than he does while wryly improvising on TV. Allen's opening is hilarious, as he recalls feeding fake commercials into the hands of unwitting announcers who find themselves speaking rotund babble on live air. Also great fun is his baldfaced stupidity as a teenager when he, his mother, and his aunt are playing cards in their Chicago hotel room and hear from a CBS radio announcer that Mars has invaded the Earth (``Gosh!'' Allen cries)--they head instantly for church and some heavy prayer, with stunned Allen still crying ``Gosh!'' We follow him through his early days as a flummoxing TV sportscaster for wrestling matches (``Leone now has his kelman frammised over the arm of Hayes' kronkheit...Ladies and gentlemen, the zime is going absolutely mctavish!''). Bored by the idea of being a deejay on his Breaking the Records radio show, Allen breaks old records rather than play them and gets a huge audience by talking without music. When his guest Doris Day fails to show up, he interviews the audience instead and invents the talk show. Allen's original Tonight Show format was much broader than today's and even took on the Mafia--here, he tells of happy/sad moments with Errol Flynn and Jack Kerouac. Better than nostalgia, sometimes serious, and often genuinely funny. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The versatile author, pianist, actor, composer, comedian, philosopher, and more here takes readers on a journey through his offbeat broadcasting experiences, from local radio to the golden years of television and beyond. He offers irresistible reminiscences of comic routines and bizarre stunts played with such memorable golden-age personalities as Bill Dana, Tom Poston, and Don Knotts. Creator of the original Tonight show, Allen also makes serious observations on the emerging talk show form and closes with reflections on the current state of the art. Except for a too-lengthy account of a 1980s comedy project gone awry, this is fast-paced, genial fun that also provides a true insider's view of TV. For circulating libraries.<br><i>- Carol J.

This is the story of an extraordinary journey of discovery that uncovers the existence of a serpent-worshipping cult that thrived throughout the world in ancient times and whose influences have permeated all the major religions. The cult&#x2019;s central rite involved mixing together snake blood and venom in a ceremonial bowl, forging a powerful healing elixir and the evidence shows that this ritual holds the key to solving such enigmatic mysteries as the Holy Grail, Elixir of Life, Philosopher&#x2019;s Stone, and the lost city of Atlantis. It&#x2019;s nothing less than a radical reinterpretation of world history.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Philip Gardiner believes that much of orthodox history is based upon propaganda in one form or another. His search for the truth has led him to uncover historical evidence which previously had been unseen for what it is. He is the author of The Shining Ones - the world&#39;s most powerful secret society revealed. And Proof - Does God Exist? - is there any evidence for the existence of god?

But Sawyer can't outrun the secrets that stalk him -- or the day of reckoning awaiting them all.<br><br><b></b></p><p>Anna Corbett is deaf and mute, but she's not stupid. When the young widow is told by her aging father-in-law, Delray Corbett, that Jack Sawyer has been hired to work their eastern Texas ranch merely as an extra pair of hands, Anna knows that it's really the news of criminal Carl Herbold's recent prison break that has Corbett hiring the tough drifter. Carl Herbold, along with his brother Cecil, swore vengeance against Corbett, their stepfather, for cooperating with the police when the two were convicted of armed robbery. The Herbold boys were also suspected of another crime--the murder of young Patsy McCorkle--but Ezzy Hardge, then sheriff of Blewer County, Texas, never found the proof needed to go to trial. Twenty years have passed, and the McCorkle murder remains a mystery. A man obsessed, Ezzy Hardge continues to search for clues that will convict the Herbolds of the monstrous murder. Soon, Carl and his brother will take their revenge. But Anna and her 5-year-old son, David, are unaware of the degree of viciousness with which the Herbold brothers can strike. Only hired hand Jack Sawyer knows the real danger, and his growing love for Anna and David keeps him close despite the impending onslaught. Yet the longer he remains in Blewer, the more he risks revealing his past--and one particular secret that may destroy his only chance at Anna's love. In <i>Unspeakable</i>, Sandra Brown once again flexes her "literary muscle," providing a fast-paced, spine-tingling tale of passion, conspiracy, and stark brutality. It's a story that unfolds through the eyes of diverse, compelling characters, and culminates in a delicious ending you won't expect. <i>--Kate Breslin</i>Carl Herbold enjoys being bad. After all, he is terrifyingly good at it. Stimulated by violence, he and his brother, Cecil, had easily graduated from juvenile delinquents to full-blown killers. And Carl, now serving a life sentence in an Arkansas penitentiary, carries out a daring escape with a fellow inmate and is on his way back to where he began - Blewer County Texas. Anna Corbett had been widowed right before her son was born. Beset by debt, deafness and personal tragedy, she faces the toughest challenge of her life - holding on to the ranch that is her son&#39;s birthright - unaware that she is at the center of Carl Herbold&#39;s vengeful plan... Along with Ezzy Hardge, a retired lawman, who is haunted by the one crime he sacrificed everything to solve but could not... And drifter Jack Sawyer, the seemingly easygoing cowboy whose past is shrouded in mystery. Carl Herbold&#39;s prison break draws them inexorably toward a day of reckoning: Ezzy, an over-the-hill peace officer seeking redemption; Jack, a man stalked by dark secrets he can no longer outrun; and Anna, a beautiful woman locked in silence and self-imposed isolation. All must grapple with their own demons before their tumultuous confrontation with a diabolical killer.</p><h2>Cheating: An Insider&#39;s Report on the Use of Race in Admissions at UCLA</h2><p>Because of California's Proposition 209, public universities such as UCLA cannot use race as a factor in admissions. However, as this book shows, UCLA gives significant preferences to African Americans, while it discriminates against Asians. The author, a professor of political science and economics at UCLA, documents what he witnessed as a member of UCLA's faculty oversight committee for admissions. <br> He also describes findings from a UCLA internal report as well as statistics from a large data set that he has posted online. All show that UCLA is breaking the law. The discrimination is not simply a byproduct of class-based preferences. For instance, for one aspect of the admissions process, a rich African American's chance of admission is almost double that of a poor Asian, even when the two applicants have identical grades, SAT scores, and other factors.</p><p></p><h2>The 4:50 From Paddington (What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!)</h2><p><p> Through the window of her first-class coach, Mrs. McGillicuddysees a woman being strangled in a passing train, No onebelieves her except her good friend Miss Marple.

The full-color drawings are charming and sentimental and the verses--although far from great poetry--reflect the nostalgic mood of the pictures. ("A is for Apple, all shiny and red. Ann picked a whole basket with big brother Ted.") As a book to help children learn the letters of the alphabet, this has limitations. The initial letters are set in small squares with traditional vine and leaf designs that contribute to the harmonious layout of the pages, but are not clear enough for easy recognition. It's a book more likely to please the large audience of adults who view childhood as a time of innocence. --Ann Stell, The Smithtown Library, NY<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.To parents with treasured early editions of A Child's Garden of Verses or Heidi , Smith's soft, period illustrations will be very familiar. An artist for Good Housekeeping during the 1920s and '30s, Smith depicted children involved in pastimes reminiscent of a simpler era: playing marbles, building sandcastles, learning to sew, lying in a hammock watching the clouds drift by. Ashton provides a sweet, melodic text that is perfectly synchronized with Smith's pictures: "L is for Luggage packed up for a trip. Laura is all set for her journey by ship." Youngsters may miss the pizzazz and punch of more contemporary-feeling alphabet books, but parents and grandparents will find this beautifully designed book a welcome change of pace.

He passes the time reading Montaigne and M.F.K. Fisher, cooking himself delicious meals, smoking an endless number of cigarettes, and nursing a grudge against the world. But his older brother, Dennis, has returned, in retreat from an unhappy marriage, and so has his estranged wife, Sonia, and their (she claims) daughter, Bellatrix, shattering Hugo's cherished solitude. He's also been told by a doctor that he has the rare Buerger's disease, which means that unless he stops smoking he will die--all the more reason for Hugo to light up, because his quarrel with life is bitter and an early death is a most attractive prospect. <br><br>As Hugo smokes and cooks and sexually schemes and pokes his perverse nose into other people&#x2019;s marriages and business, he records these events as well as his mordant, funny, gorgeously articulated personal history and his thoughts on life and mortality in a series of notebooks. His is one of the most perversely compelling literary personalities to inhabit a novel since John Lanchester&#x2019;s <i>The Debt to Pleasure</i>, and his ancestors include the divinely cracked and eloquent narrators of the works of Nabokov. As snobbish and dislikable as Hugo is, his worldview is so enticingly conveyed that even the most resistant reader will be put under his spell. His insinuating voice gets into your head and under your skin in the most seductive way. And as he prepares what may be his final Christmas feast for family and friends, readers will have to ask, &#x201c;Is this the end of Hugo?&#x201d;<br><br><i>The Epicure&#x2019;s Lament</i> is a wry and witty novel about love and death and family, a major contribution to a vein of literature that the author Kate Christensen has dubbed &#x201c;loser lit.&#x201d; It more than fulfills the bright promise of her lavishly praised previous two novels, and gives us an antihero for our time--hard to like, impossible to resist.</p><p><p>&#x201c;What a wonderfully monstrous voice Kate Christensen has created in Hugo Whittier, trust-fund misanthrope, chain-smoking foodie, confirmed cad.

He lives in Maryland with his wife, Julie, and son Paul.ONE <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br> <i>The</i> mansion was isolated and Gothic, massive, trapped in a wood, grotesque. It crouched beneath the stars under clustered spires like something enormous and deformed, unable to hide, wanting to sin. Its gargoyles grinned at the forest pressing in on it thickly all around. For a time nothing moved. Dawn sifted in. Thin fall sunlight pried at the morning entombed within the arborescent gloom, and fog curled up from rotted leaves like departing souls, dry and weak. In the breeze, a creaking shutter moaned for Duncan and a haunted crow coughed hoarsely in a meadow far away. Then silence. Waiting. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>The voice of a man from within the mansion carried with firm conviction, startling a small green heron from the moat. <br>&#x201c;Robert Browning had the clap and he caught it from Charlotte and Emily Bront�.&#x201d; <br>A second man, angry, bellowed, &#x201c;Cutshaw, shut your mouth!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He caught it from <i>both</i> of them.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c; <i>Shut up, you crazy bastard!</i>&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want to hear the truth.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Krebs, sound assembly!&#x201d; the angry man ordered. <br>Then a military bugling shattered the air, ripping into the fog, and an American flag, fluttering defiance, leaped up a pole atop a spire. Twenty-seven men in green fatigues exploded like shrapnel from the mansion and hurtled out to the center of its courtyard, muttering and mumbling and crooking their elbows, dress-right-dress, in the forming of a military line. Above their denims some affected other dress: one wore a rapier and golden earrings; from the head of another bloomed a coonskin cap. Imprecations floated up from them like steam alive with sparks: <br>&#x201c;Hillo ho ho, boys! Come, bird, come!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You know, I wish you&#x2019;d douche; sincerely.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sink the <i>Bismarck</i>!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Watch the elbow!&#x201d; <br>A man with a shaggy mongrel dog in his arms burst into the center of the line. He bawled, &#x201c;My cape! Have you seen my cape?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Hell, what&#x2019;s a cape?&#x201d; snarled the one with the sword. &#x201c;Just fucking fabric.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Fabric?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Foolish fucking fabric.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What country is this?&#x201d; asked a man at the end of the line. <br>A blond-haired man confronted them briskly. He wore tattered and dirty black Keds, his left big toe protruding through a hole; and over his fatigues he flaunted a New York University sweater: on the sleeve of one arm were letterman&#x2019;s stripes, and on the other, a NASA astronaut&#x2019;s patch. &#x201c;Attention!&#x201d; he commanded with authority. &#x201c;It is I, Billy Cutshaw!&#x201d; <br>The men obeyed, then stiffly raised their arms in the salute of ancient Rome. &#x201c;Captain Billy, let us serve you!&#x201d; they howled into the fog; then they dropped their arms and stood unmoving, hushed, like the damned awaiting judgment. <br>Cutshaw&#x2019;s gaze flicked over them swiftly, flashing and mysterious, luminous and deep. At last he spoke: <br>&#x201c;Lieutenant Bennish!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sah!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You may take three giant steps and kiss the hem of my garment!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c; <i>Sah!&#x201d;</i> <br>&#x201c;The <i>hem,</i> Bennish, mind you, the <i>hem!</i>&#x201d; <br>Bennish took three steps forward, then cracked his heels together resoundingly. Cutshaw measured him with reserve. &#x201c;Excellent form, Bennish.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Thank you very much, sir.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let it go to your fucking head. There is nothing more vile than <i>hubris.</i>&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir. You&#x2019;ve said that many times, sir.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I know that, Bennish.&#x201d; Cutshaw was probing him with his gaze, as though seeking out insolence and outrage, when the man with the sword bawled, &#x201c;Here comes the fuzz!&#x201d; <br>The men began booing as out from the mansion, in angry stride, marched the starched and militant figure of a major in the Marine Corps. Cutshaw scuttled into the line, and over the booing the man with the sword shouted out at the major, &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s my Ho Chi Minh decoder ring? I sent in the goddam boxtops, Groper; where the hell&#x2019;s the&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c; <i>Quiet!</i>&#x201d; Groper quelled them. His little eyes seared out from a face that was pummeled beef adorned with a crew cut. He was hulking and heavy of bone. &#x201c;Fucking weirdo, yellow smart-ass college pricks!&#x201d; he snarled. <br>&#x201c; <i>That</i> says it,&#x201d; muttered someone in the ranks. <br>Groper paced the rank of men, his great head lowered as though ready to charge them. &#x201c;Who in the hell do you think you&#x2019;re kidding with your phony little squirrel act? Well, bad news, boys. Tough shit. &#x2019;Cause guess who&#x2019;s coming to take command next week! Can you guess, boys? Huh? A <i>psychiatrist!</i>&#x201d; He was suddenly roaring, quivering with uncontrollable rage. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right! The best! The best in uniform! The greatest fucking psychiatrist since Jung!&#x201d; He pronounced the J. <br>Now he stood breathing heavily, gathering air and dominion. &#x201c;Fucking combat-shirking bastards! He&#x2019;s coming to find out if you&#x2019;re really psycho!&#x201d; Groper grinned, his eyes shining. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that great news, boys?&#x201d; <br>Cutshaw took one step forward. &#x201c;Could we knock off this &#x2018;boys&#x2019; shit, Major, please? It makes us feel like we&#x2019;re cocker spaniels and you&#x2019;re the Old Pirate in <i>Tortilla Flat.</i> Could we&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c; <i>Back into line!</i>&#x201d; <br>Cutshaw squeezed a rubber horn in his hand the size of a baseball. It emitted a raucous, unpleasant sound. <br>Groper rasped, &#x201c;Cutshaw, what have you got there?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;A foghorn,&#x201d; answered Cutshaw. &#x201c;Chinese junks have been reported in the area.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Someday I&#x2019;ll break your back, I promise you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Someday I&#x2019;m going to leave Fort Zinderneuf; I&#x2019;m getting tired of propping up bodies.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I wish they&#x2019;d clobbered you in space,&#x201d; said Groper. <br>The men began to hiss. <br>&#x201c;Quiet!&#x201d; barked Groper. <br>The hissing grew louder. <br>&#x201c;Yeah, hissing you&#x2019;re good at, you slimy little snakes.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Bra- <i>vo!</i> Bra- <i>vo!</i>&#x201d; commended Cutshaw, leading the men in polite applause. Others added their praise: <br>&#x201c;Good image.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Splendid, Groper! Splendid!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Just one more thing, sir,&#x201d; Cutshaw began. <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Stick a pineapple up your ass.&#x201d; Cutshaw looked away. He felt a premonition. &#x201c;Somebody&#x2019;s coming,&#x201d; he said. <br>It was a prayer. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 1978 by William Peter Blatty</p><h2>cGraw Hill Reading Wonders, Teacher&#39;s Edition, Grade 4, Unit 6.

In <i>Unforgivable Blackness</i>, the prizewinning biographer Geoffrey C. Ward brings to vivid life the real Jack Johnson, a figure far more complex and compelling than the newspaper headlines he inspired could ever convey. Johnson battled his way from obscurity to the top of the heavyweight ranks and in 1908 won the greatest prize in American sports&#x2013;one that had always been the private preserve of white boxers. At a time when whites ran everything in America, he took orders from no one and resolved to live as if color did not exist. While most blacks struggled just to survive, he reveled in his riches and his fame. And at a time when the mere suspicion that a black man had flirted with a white woman could cost him his life, he insisted on sleeping with whomever he pleased, and married three. Because he did so the federal government set out to destroy him, and he was forced to endure a year of prison and seven years of exile. Ward points out that to most whites (and to some African Americans as well) he was seen as a perpetual threat&#x2013;profligate, arrogant, amoral, a dark menace, and a danger to the natural order of things.<br><i><br>Unforgivable Blackness</i> is the first full-scale biography of Johnson in more than twenty years. Accompanied by more than fifty photographs and drawing on a wealth of new material&#x2013;including Johnson&#x2019;s never-before-published prison memoir&#x2013;it restores Jack Johnson to his rightful place in the pantheon of American individualists.</p><p>Geoffrey C.

He lives in New York City.The Pure-Blooded American<br><br>In the spring of 1910, Halley&#x2019;s comet returned to the heavens after an absence of seventy-five years. Some believed it a sign from God that the world was about to end. Nearly everyone saw it as a momentous event, and during the week of May 18, when astronomers predicted the earth would pass through the comet&#x2019;s tail, adults and sleepy children all over the country stumbled out of their homes at night to see if they could get a glimpse of it.<br><br>On the Lower East Side of New York, thousands of tenement dwellers, mostly immigrants and their families, filled the streets to peer up at the cloudy skies, while on the roof of the Waldorf-Astoria hotel uptown, Speaker of the House Joseph G. Cannon led two hundred tuxedoed guests attending the annual dinner of the National Association of Manufacturers in a champagne toast to the comet&#x2019;s passing. In Memphis, Tennessee, separate all-night revivals were held for white and black believers awaiting Judgment Day. In Chicago, panicked householders blocked their doors and windows against deadly gases they believed the comet would release.<br><br>And early one morning, at the fashionable Seal Rock House on Ocean Beach at San Francisco&#x2019;s western edge, guests and staff members alike gathered on the sand beneath the stars, listening to the rhythm of the surf and waiting to chart the comet&#x2019;s brilliant course above the sea.<br><br>But the hotel&#x2019;s most celebrated guest&#x2014;the most celebrated black man on earth&#x2014;remained in bed in his suite on the second floor. A member of his entourage had slipped up the stairs a few minutes earlier and tried to rouse him, but the heavyweight champion of the world had ordered him out of the room. He saw no need to get up. Over the coming centuries there would be hundreds of comets, he said. &#x201c;But there ain&#x2019;t gonna be but one Jack Johnson.&#x201d;<br><br>Like a good many of his claims, this one was both outrageous and entirely accurate. He had, after all, battered his way from obscurity to the top of the heavyweight ranks and won the greatest prize in American sports&#x2014;a prize that had always been the private preserve of white combatants. At a time when whites ran everything in America, he took orders from no one and resolved to live always as if color did not exist. While most Negroes struggled merely to survive, he reveled in his riches and his fame. And at a time when the mere suspicion that a black man had flirted with a white woman could cost him his life, he insisted on sleeping with whomever he pleased. Most whites (and some Negroes as well) saw him as a perpetual threat&#x2014;profligate, arrogant, amoral, a dark menace, and a danger to the natural order of things.<br><br>The real Jack Johnson was both more and less than those who loved or those who hated him ever knew. He embodied American individualism in its purest form; nothing&#x2014;no law or custom, no person white or black, male or female&#x2014;could keep him for long from whatever he wanted. He was in the great American tradition of self-invented men, too, and no one admired his handiwork more than he did. All his life, whites and blacks alike would ask him, &#x201c;Just who do you think you are?&#x201d; The answer, of course, was always &#x201c;Jack Johnson&#x201d;&#x2014;and that would prove to be more than enough for turn-of-the-twentieth-century America to handle.<br><br>Johnson visited Paris for the first time in June of 1908, before sailing to Australia and his long-delayed battle with the heavyweight champion Tommy Burns. It may have been then that he and an unknown French journalist began laboring together over the manuscript that would become the first of his autobiographies.* The language of its opening passage seems stilted, especially in translation, but the thoughts are unmistakably Jack Johnson&#x2019;s:<br><br>When a white man writes his memoirs . . . he anxiously begins with the history of his family from earliest times. It seems the higher one ascends the more interested one is in it. And I think that most authors embroider their genealogy. Basically, none of it interests anyone other than family members.<br><br>But I don&#x2019;t want to exempt myself from this ancient custom and wish to say a few words about my genealogy.<br><br>Our [Negro] memories are handed down from father to son. Whites don&#x2019;t think so, but we blacks are also proud of our ancestors and during long days and still longer nights, though we knew neither schools nor books, we still transmited memories of past centuries. I don&#x2019;t doubt that the stories have been modified over time, but the salient facts remain. If some parts are merely fables it doesn&#x2019;t matter much. Who can tell among the white stories what is fact and what is fable?<br><br>Facts about Johnson&#x2019;s ancestry are hard to come by, and he was himself a cheerful fabulist when it came to retelling his own life. But the first thing he wanted people to understand about him was that because his enslaved forebears had arrived in America long &#x201c;before the United States was dreamed of,&#x201d; he was himself a &#x201c;pure-blooded American.&#x201d; And because he knew that that was what he was, he saw no reason ever to accept any limitations on himself to which other Americans were not also subject.*<br><br>Why he insisted on acting that way at a time when most American Negroes were relegated to second-class citizenship remains the essential mystery of his life. No amount of sleuthing will ever fully solve it, but a few clues may lie half-hidden in what little we know of his boyhood.<br><br>He was born Arthur John Johnson in Galveston, Texas, on March 31, 1878, the year after the last Union troops were withdrawn from the former Confederacy, leaving freed blacks to fend for themselves.&#x2020; His parents, Henry and Tina (known as Tiny) Johnson, both ex-slaves, did just that. She was from either North or South Carolina; government records and her son&#x2019;s various accounts differ. Henry was born in Maryland or Virginia sometime during the 1830s; after serving as a civilian teamster attached to the U.S. Army&#x2019;s 38th (Colored) Infantry, he settled in Galveston in 1867. His son loyally remembered him as &#x201c;the most perfect physical specimen I have ever seen.&#x201d; In fact, Henry stood just five foot five and was severely disabled by an atrophied right leg, the result of exposure to cold and rain and snow in the trenches at Petersburg, Virginia, that had caused the &#x201c;disease of rheumatism&#x201d; to distort his right knee&#x2014;or so his attorneys would later claim in one of several unsuccessful bids he made for a veteran&#x2019;s pension.<br><br>Despite his injury, despite the fact that he could not read and that neither he nor his wife could write, Henry Johnson never failed to find ways to support his family. He worked as a porter in a saloon, then as a school janitor, finally as supervising janitor for Galveston&#x2019;s East School District. His wife took in washing. Both were faithful Methodists, and Henry sometimes helped with the preaching on Sundays; Jack Johnson&#x2019;s glib tongue and enthusiasm for public speaking may have been an inheritance from him.<br><br>The Johnsons had nine children, four of whom lived to adulthood. They kept them all fed and clothed, saw to it that they attended at least five years of school, and somehow managed to put enough money aside to buy a plot of land at 808 Broadway at the island&#x2019;s eastern end, and build their own single-story home.<br><br>Jack was the Johnsons&#x2019; third child and first son, and from the beginning seems to have been the focus of his family&#x2019;s attention. He was bright, talkative, and filled with energy, but, as he and his mother both remembered, he&#x2019;d also been frail as a small boy and was still so thin at twelve that the family physician warned he might be tubercular. Like his sisters and brothers, he was expected from early childhood to help keep the family going. He swept out schoolrooms to ease his father&#x2019;s burdens. &#x201c;Those devilish brooms were taller than I was,&#x201d; he remembered. &#x201c;It was sure the joy of my early life to grow taller than the broomstick.&#x201d; And he got an early morning job, riding along on a milk wagon to keep an eye on the horse when the milkman got down to make a delivery. Every Saturday night, he was paid ten cents and a brand-new pair of bright-red socks, of which his employer evidently had a limitless supply.<br><br>Otherwise, Jack remained at home with his older sisters, Lucy and Jennie, and his younger siblings, Henry and Fannie and an adopted brother named Charles. He was especially close to his mother, who told him again and again he was &#x201c;the best boy in the world&#x201d; and assured him he could do anything he wanted if he wanted it badly enough.<br><br>Jack Johnson seems to have needed little encouragement along those lines. He saw himself as someone special from the first&#x2014;someone set apart, not subject to the limitations holding others back. His mother liked to recall what he told her one evening when he was still a small boy doing his homework by lamplight. As she told it,<br><br>Jack was reading in the Texas history book about great men, and he turns around to me and he allowed as how he was going to be a great man himself some one of these days. And I says, &#x201c;Shucks, boy, what you talking about? What you think you&#x2019;re going to be&#x2014;president?&#x201d; He said, no, he wasn&#x2019;t figuring on being president, but he expects he&#x2019;ll be something what&#x2019;ll be just about as big. And that child sure was talking a parable that night.<br><br>Johnson would remain deeply devoted to Tiny Johnson until her death, lavishing her with gifts and telling reporters she had been responsible for all his success. After her death, he delivered a pulpit talk called &#x201c;The Influence of My Christian Mother&#x201d; before black congregations in several cities. In it, he urged his listeners to R...</p><h2>Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television</h2><p><p> A total departure from previous writing about television, this book is the first ever to advocate that the medium is not reformable. Its problems are inherent in the technology itself and are so dangerous -- to personal health and sanity, to the environment, and to democratic processes -- that TV ought to be eliminated forever.</p><p>Weaving personal experiences through meticulous research, the author ranges widely over aspects of television that have rarely been examined and never before joined together, allowing an entirely new, frightening image to emerge. The idea that all technologies are "neutral," benign instruments that can be used well or badly, is thrown open to profound doubt. Speaking of TV reform is, in the words of the author, "as absurd as speaking of the reform of a technology such as guns."</p></p><p><p>Jerry Mander holds B.S. and M.S. degrees in Economics, spent 15 years in the advertising business, including five as president and partner of Freeman, Mander &amp; Gossage, San Francisco, one of the most celebrated agencies in the country.

As a boy, he lives to decipher the odors of Paris, and apprentices himself to a prominent perfumer who teaches him the ancient art of mixing precious oils and herbs. But Grenouille's genius is such that he is not satisfied to stop there, and he becomes obsessed with capturing the smells of objects such as brass doorknobs and frest-cut wood. Then one day he catches a hint of a scent that will drive him on an ever-more-terrifying quest to create the "ultimate perfume"-the scent of a beautiful young virgin.

He wouldn't, though. For one thing, even if nothing else in his life made sense, his son was the most important person in it. Kevin wouldn't let him down. For another, either Gram or his dad would be up here next, and either one of them had the power to shame him into doing what was right for the occasion.<br><br>"On my way," he assured Connor.<br><br>He showered in record time, pulled on jeans and a T-shirt and slid his feet into an old pair of sneakers, then went downstairs. Only his youngest sister, Jess, was in the kitchen. She surveyed him, then shook her head.<br><br>"You're a mess," she declared.<br><br>"I showered. These clothes are clean," he protested.<br><br>"Did you lose your razor? And maybe your comb?"<br><br>"Who are you?" he grumbled. "The fashion patrol?"<br><br>"Just calling it like I see it, big brother. Everyone else spruced up for the party. Turning two is a big deal."<br><br>"Do you honestly think Davy's going to care if I shaved?" he asked as he rubbed his hand over his unshaven jaw. He had shaved yesterday&#x2014;or was it the day before? He couldn't recall. Mostly the days slipped by in a blur.<br><br>"No, Davy won't care today, but you'll look like some derelict in the pictures. Is that the memory you want him to carry with him throughout his life? Last year on his first birthday it made sense that you looked ragged. It was only a few weeks after Georgia&#x2014;"<br><br>"Don't mention her name," he snapped.<br><br>"Someone has to," she said, looking him directly in the eye without backing down. "You loved her, Kev. I get that. You're hurting and angry because she's gone, but you can't pretend she didn't exist. She was that little boy's mom. What are you planning to do, let him go through his entire life with the subject of his mother off-limits? What about his grandparents? Do you expect them never to mention their daughter's name?"<br><br>" <em>I </em>can't talk about her. Not yet." He knew it was irrational, but somehow he thought if he didn't talk about Georgia or her death, it wouldn't be real. She'd still be out there, on the other side of the world, saving lives. She'd still walk through the door one day, back into his life.<br><br>"When, then?" Jess asked, her gaze unrelenting.<br><br>If he hadn't been so annoyed, he might have admired her persistence. For a woman who rarely stuck with anything for long, Jess had certainly dug in her heels on this. Just his freaking luck.<br><br>"What do you expect me to say?" he snapped again. "A day? A month? Hell if I know when I'll be ready." Even as he spoke, he felt the sting of tears in his eyes. He hated the sign of weakness almost as much as he hated this whole conversation. "Just drop it, okay?"<br><br>Of course she didn't. "Sit down," she ordered, not cutting him any slack.<br><br>He didn't like that Jess was turning the tables on him. His little sister had always come to him for advice. Now she was obviously planning to dole it out. Just like Georgia, once Jess got stirred up, she was going to speak her mind, whether anyone wanted to listen or not. Apparently this was one of those times. Kevin sat, mostly because he was too shaky not to and because she'd plunked a cup of much-needed coffee on the table to go with whatever words she was intent on dishing out.<br><br>She pulled a chair close and sat so that her knees were brushing his. She covered one of his hands with hers. The show of sympathy was almost his undoing.<br><br>"Listen to me, Kev. You need to get out of this house."<br><br>Alarm shot through him. "Why? Has Gram said something? Is having Davy underfoot too much for her? Do she and Dad want me out of here?"<br><br>She rolled her eyes. "You know better," she said impatiently. "This is your home. I wasn't saying you should move. I was saying you need to get a life." Her gaze, locked with his, was filled with compassion. "I know this is going to sound harsh, but somebody needs to say it. Georgia died. You didn't. And Davy needs his dad, the real one, not the one who walks around here all day in a daze."<br><br>He frowned at her. "I'm not drinking, if that's what you're suggesting."<br><br>"Nobody said you were. Look, I'm saying all this now, before everyone else has a chance to gang up on you. You know it's coming. You must. This family can't keep their opinions to themselves worth a damn. It's amazing we've all been so quiet for this long."<br><br>He smiled, despite his sour mood. "You're right about that."<br><br>"Will you at least think about what I've said? If you promise to do that much, I'll run interference and keep the others at bay a while longer. Abby, the mother hen, is champing at the bit to offer her own special brand of tough love. She's worried sick that you haven't snapped out of this dark mood."<br><br>Since he would do just about anything to keep from being surrounded by all that well-meaning concern, especially from his oldest sister, he nodded. "There's just one thing."<br><br>"Oh?"<br><br>"I don't have any idea at all what to do with myself."<br><br>"You're a paramedic," she reminded him at once. "There are openings right here in town. I've checked."<br><br>He shook his head. "No. I'll never do that again." His career was all twisted up in his mind with Georgia and how she'd died on a call to a market in Baghdad after an explosive device had been triggered, killing and wounding a bunch of innocent civilians. She and her team had arrived just in time for the second bomb to be detonated. Kevin knew his reaction, his refusal to put his EMT training to good use, wasn't rational, but then he wasn't operating much on reason these days.<br><br>"You sure about that?" Jess asked.<br><br>"A hundred percent."<br><br>Her expression brightened. "Then I have an even better idea."<br><br>He didn't like the glint in her eyes one bit. Jess had always had a knack for getting into mischief. Ideas came fast and furiously with her. It was the follow-through that was lacking. Or had been, anyway, until she'd opened The Inn at Eagle Point. That seemed to have captured her complete attention. After a shaky start, she had the place running smoothly and successfully.<br><br>"What's your idea?" he asked warily.<br><br>"A fishing charter," she said at once, then rushed in before he could utter an immediate objection. "You could lease dock space at the Harbor Lights Marina. Come on, Kev, at least think about it. You spent half your life on the water as a kid. You always claimed it calmed you, even if you didn't come home with a single rockfish or croaker. And naturally, because you didn't really give two hoots about catching them, the fish practically jumped into your boat."<br><br>"You want me to become a waterman?" he asked incredulously. It was a hard, demanding life, especially with the impact that farming and other human misdeeds were having on fish, crabs and oysters in the bay's waters, to say nothing of what skyrocketing fuel costs had done to profit margins.<br><br>"Not exactly. I want you to take people out on your boat to fish."<br><br>He gave her a wry look. "The only boat I currently own is barely big enough for me and one passenger, and I wind up rowing home more often than not because the motor's unreliable."<br><br>"Which is exactly why you'll spend some of that trust fund money that's sitting in the bank on a bigger, more reliable boat. Dad set up those funds for us to buy a home or start a business. I know you haven't touched yours, so the start-up money's there, Kev."<br><br>"And you think this can become an actual career?" he asked skeptically.<br><br>"It's not up there with saving lives," she said pointedly. "But I get requests practically every day from guests at the inn who want to go fishing. There's no one in town who does charters. Once in a while I can convince George Jenkins to take someone out, but he has the conversational skills of a clam."<br><br>Kevin thought about the long, lazy days he and Connor had spent on the bay as boys. They were some of the best in his life. He hadn't cared a fig about catching fish, just as Jess said, but he'd loved the peace and quiet of being on the water. Of course, if he had a boat full of strangers along, the tranquillity would pretty much be shattered. Yet somehow the idea took hold.<br><br>Jess regarded him hopefully. "You'll think about it?"<br><br>There were a thousand practical things to be considered, but the idea held promise. He'd have to take classes to become licensed to be a captain, for example, and that would get him out of the house. Maybe that alone would be enough to keep everyone off his case.<br><br>He nodded slowly. "I'll think about it."<br><br>"Good! Now let's go outside and spoil that son of yours rotten," Jess said, dragging him to his feet. "You should see his haul of presents. They're piled high. Davy doesn't entirely understand yet that they're his, so this should be fun."<br><br>Fun wasn't something Kevin had had in his life for a while now, but when he saw Davy running around on his chubby little legs, his mouth already streaked with chocolate frosting, he couldn't help but feel a little lighter. And when Davy spotted his father and a smile spread across his face, Kevin felt a split second of pure joy. It was Georgia's smile, as bright and carefree as she had been.<br><br>For the first time since his wife had died, the sorrow lifted briefly and he felt hopeful again.<br><br>Despite his promise to Jess, Kevin spent two more weeks holed up at home, passing his days with Davy and his evenings hiding out in his room away from Gram's pitying looks and his father's increasing impatience. Mick clearly had plenty to say to him, Kevin could tell, but apparently an edict from Gram had kept his father silent. He doubted that would last much longer.<br><br>To his surprise, it was Gram herself who broke the silence first. She joined him on the porch at dusk one evening, handed him a glass of iced tea and a plate of his favorite oatmeal raisin cookies and said, "We need to talk."<br><br>"About?" Kevin asked, even more wary than he had been when Jess had made the same announcement. If Jess was good at uncomfortable, straight talk, it was because she'd learned from a master&#x2014;their grandmother. Nell O'Brien had stepped in to raise them after their mother and father had divorced. She had a huge heart and a tart tongue.<br><br>"The way you're moping around this house day in and day out," she replied. "It's not good for you, and it's certainly not good for your boy. A child needs to expand his world, to see other children."<br><br>Kevin frowned at that. "His cousins are here all the time."<br><br>"Caitlyn and Carrie are almost eight now, and while they love playing with Davy, he needs to be with some youngsters his own age." She gave him a penetrating look. "He needs to laugh, Kevin. When was the last time you got down on the ground and rough-housed with him, made him giggle?"<br><br>"Seems to me that Dad's filling that role." In fact, Mick seemed to delight in it.<br><br>"It's his father who ought to be doing it, not his grandfather. When was the last time you took Davy into town for an ice-cream cone?"<br><br>"You took him just yesterday," Kevin reminded her.<br><br>Gram gave him an impatient look. "Is that what I asked? I want to know when <em>you </em>took him."<br><br>"I haven't," he admitted. "But I don't see why that's such a big deal. Davy's got plenty of attention around here. That's why I moved back to Chesapeake Shores."<br><br>"So we could raise him for you?" she asked. The question was pointed, though her tone was gentle.<br><br>"No, of course not," he retorted, then regretted his tone and sighed. "Maybe."<br><br>"Kevin, we all know you're grieving over Georgia, and there's not a thing we wouldn't do to help out, but you have to start living again. You have to give Davy a more normal life. I know Jess has talked to you about this, so I waited, but you're showing no signs of changing. I can't go on watching you shortchange Davy or yourself like this. It's just plain wrong. You're a vital young man with a lot of years ahead of you. Don't waste them and live to regret it."<br><br>As much as he hated to admit it, Kevin knew she was right. He just had no idea precisely what he could do about it, not when he was filled with so many conflicting emotions. He was angry about a war that had taken a child's mother and left him a single dad. He was guilt-ridden about not having tried harder to make Georgia reconsider taking another tour in Iraq, even after just about everyone in his family had begged him to. And he was grieving for a vibrant young woman who would never know her son, who wouldn't be there for his first day of school, his college graduation, his wedding.<br><br>He finally lifted his head and faced his grandmother. "Gram, I have no idea what to do. Some days just getting out of bed seems like a triumph."<br><br>She nodded knowingly. "That's the way I felt when your grandfather died. I'm sure it's the way Mick felt when your mother left him alone with all of you children to raise. You know how he handled that."<br><br></p><h2>Marvel Masterworks: Silver Surfer: Volume 1 (Barnes and Noble Edition)</h2><p>Hardcover Barnes and Noble edition.</p><p></p><h2>Words That Built a Nation: A Young Person&#39;s Collection of Historic American Documents</h2><p>Presents and explores how many famous American documents and speeches impacted the political and social structure of the nation throughout the years.</p><p><b>Marilyn Miller</b> is a freelance writer and editor in New York City.

Eliot and Christianity</h2><p>Barry Spurr&#39;s eagerly-awaited, definitive study of T.S. Eliot&#39;s Anglo-Catholic belief and practice shows how the poet&#39;s religion shaped his life and work for almost forty years, until his death in 1965. The author examines Eliot&#39;s formal adoption of Anglo-Catholicism, in 1927, as the culmination of his intellectual, cultural, artistic, spiritual and personal development to that point. This book presents the first detailed analysis of the unique influence that Anglo-Catholicism&#39;s doctrinal and devotional principles, and its social teaching, had on Eliot&#39;s poetry, plays, prose and personal life. An informed presentation and discussion of Anglo-Catholicism at the time of Eliot&#39;s conversion and through the subsequent decades of his Christian faith and practice. Significant new material from correspondence and diaries which sheds light on Eliot&#39;s thought, poetry and prose. This book is essential reading for all scholars and readers of T.S. Eliot and his circle; for students and devotees of Anglo-Catholicism, and scholars of the interaction between literature and theology, especially in the twentieth century. It will also be of use to senior and Honours-level undergraduates and postgraduate research students working in the fields of Modernism and its principles and belief systems, and for students of religion, especially Western Christianity and Anglicanism.</p><p>Barry Spurr has been a member of the Sydney University English Department for more than thirty years. Publishing widely on Renaissance and Modernist poetics, his previous books include &#34;The Word in the Desert&#34; (1995), &#34;Lytton Strachey&#34; (1995), and the acclaimed &#34;Studying Poetry &#34;(Palgrave Macmillan 2006), now in its second edition. His next book will be on T.S. Eliot&#39;s Anglo-Catholicism."Spurr considers every area of Eliot's writing with a view to showing what a full understanding of his religious ideas and practices might reveal." (David Fuller <i>Modern Believing, 54.3, July 2013</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Spurr&#x2019;s book is comprehensively excellent on the nature and history of twentieth century Anglo-Catholicism, on Eliot&#x2019;s reputation as an Anglo-Catholic, his observance of its practices, his associations within Anglo-Catholic circles, and its expressions in his creative work...

But as Douglas L. Wilson shows us in Honor's Voice, Lincoln's transformation was not one long triumphal march, but a process that was more than once seriously derailed. There were times, in his journey from storekeeper and mill operator to lawyer and member of the Illinois state legislature, when Lincoln lost his nerve and self-confidence - on at least two occasions he became so despondent as to appear suicidal - and when his acute emotional vulnerabilities were exposed.<br><br>Focusing on the crucial years between 1831 and 1842, Wilson's skillful analysis of the testimonies and writings of Lincoln's contemporaries reveals the individual behind the legends. We see Lincoln as a boy: not the dutiful son studying by firelight, but the stubborn rebel determined to make something of himself. We see him as a young man: not the ascendant statesman, but the canny local politician who was renowned for his talents in wrestling and storytelling (as well as for his extensive store of off-color jokes). Wilson also reconstructs Lincoln's frequently anguished personal life: his religious skepticism, recurrent bouts of depression, and difficult relationships with women - from Ann Rutledge to Mary Owens to Mary Todd.<br><br>Meticulously researched and well written, this is a fascinating book that makes us reexamine our ideas about one of the icons of American history.</p><p>"The more I read of Honor's Voice, the more enthralled I became by the Lincoln who emerges in its pages, and the greater my admiration for the scholarship and insights of Douglas L. Wilson. This is an altogether fascinating and revealing look at an im-mensely human Abraham Lincoln, about whom we can never know enough."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- David McCullough<br>Douglas L.

It was formed hundreds of millions of years ago in a crucible of immense heat and pressure, a tectonic upheaval as volcanoes erupted and the continental plates of Pangaea, the supercontinent, ground against each other. They divided, creating a vast gulf that would separate the Eastern Seaboard from North Africa. It is a rock. It is an island.<br> <br>� &nbsp; � &nbsp; �<br> <br>Manhattan is a geologist&#x2019;s dream. But sophisticated on-site analysis of what lies beneath the surface is a relatively recent phenomenon. Construction of Water Tunnel No. 3, as deep as six hundred feet below street level, the Second Avenue Subway, the Flushing Line Subway Extension, and the Long Island Rail Road&#x2019;s East Side Access project to Grand Central Terminal under Park Avenue opened a basement window for geologists to confirm their vision of how Manhattan was formed and why skyscrapers sprouted downtown and in midtown but not in between.<br> <br>Depending on where you live in Manhattan, you can&#x2019;t honestly say it&#x2019;s not your fault. What geologists found was a wide variety of metamorphic rock&#x2014;formed as tectonic plates collided&#x2014;and distinct geological fault lines along Dyckman Street, 125th Street, Morningside Drive, and Canal Street, suggested by water coursing through the paths of least resistance, fractures and fissures that reached across the spine of Manhattan between the East and Hudson Rivers. While Manhattan schist is the best known of the rock formations that form the city&#x2019;s subbasement, the island is also defined by amphibolite, by Inwood marble farther uptown, and by Fordham gneiss, which predominates in the Bronx, on Roosevelt Island, and on the Lower East Side (and protruding on &#x201c;C-rock&#x201d; opposite the Columbia University athletic complex).<br> <br>Gneiss (pronounced &#x201c;nice&#x201d;) dates back a dazzling 1.2 billion years, when earth-shattering continental collisions caused sedimentary rock to recrystallize into contorted black-and-white-banded metamorphic rock. It is the oldest natural New York object. (The oldest objects in New York are 4.6-billion-year-old meteors and 10-�billion-year-old stardust&#x2014;actually, presolar grains in primitive chondrites&#x2014;at the American Museum of Natural History. The oldest handcrafted object in Manhattan is considered to be the obelisk known as Cleopatra&#x2019;s Needle, dating from 1450 B.C. and installed in Central Park in 1881.)<br> <br>The interlayered rock formations belowground are analogous to the intermixed neighborhoods on the surface. The granites are folded into tunnel walls exposed by monstrous rock-boring machines. The undulating formations are the bedrock that defines Manhattan&#x2019;s skyline. In midtown, bedrock is just below the asphalt. To build the World Trade Center, seventy-five feet of fill, glacial till, and muck had to be excavated until bedrock was reached. In between downtown and midtown, the bedrock surface dips into a deeper trough and the ground is relatively squishy, which means that a century or so ago, building a skyscraper there would have been too challenging for contemporary engineering. Today, while it may be prohibitively expensive, such construction is technologically possible. Good rocks, geologists like to say, make good foundations and good tunnels.<br> <br>Underground Manhattan is laced with unseen, taken-for-granted tunnels, the latest of which is the East Side Access, 170 feet below Park Avenue. It stretches from the East Sixty-Third Street tunnel under the East River, which it shares with the subway from Queens, and terminates at East Thirty-Sixth Street, just below the Union League Club. (A Manhattan portion of the sixty-mile-long third water tunnel, which has been under construction for four decades and is scheduled for completion around 2020, opened in 2013; the Long Island Rail Road&#x2019;s direct East Side Access is now expected to start around 2020.)<br> <br>Legally, landlords own the land beneath their property to the center of the earth, so tunnels require easements, which, in the case of government agencies, can be obtained through negotiation or by exercising the right of eminent domain. An advance team of geologists mines the excavations to verify topographical details of the original shoreline and underground water courses still derived from the pre-development 1865 map of Egbert Viele (a civil engineer and congressman), to adjust engineering specifications to the conditions that are discovered, and to leave a geological record for posterity. Finding amphibolite and similar rock formations migrating like baked taffy&#x2014;one geologist likened the pattern to a Charleston Chew&#x2014;in both Manhattan and Morocco provides evidence substantiating Alfred Wegener&#x2019;s once ridiculed theory of continental drift.</p><h2>Tuck Everlasting, 25th Anniversary Edition</h2><p>Critically acclaimed when it was first published, <i>Tuck Everlasting </i>has become a much-loved, well-studied modern-day classic.

Huntington's "The Clash of Civilizations." Since then, Robert Kaplan's anti-utopian vision of the fault lines of the twentyfirst century has taken on the status of a paradigm. "The Coming Anarchy" has been hailed as the defining thesis for understanding the post-Cold War world.<br><br>At the heart of this book is a question as old as America and one that is crucial to our national self-definition: what can and should we do when violence breaks out in countries far from our borders? A work of uncompromising honesty, The Coming Anarchy is the first book to present a coherent picture of the political views of a man who has shaped national dialogue in this decade on key issues of international relations. (The New York Times called Kaplan's Balkan Ghosts "the bestknown volume associated with the Clinton Presidency.") <br><br>The Coming Anarchy takes on some of the most difficult issues we will be grappling with and living through in the next century. When we speak about the resurgence of ethnic violence, the social pressures of disease, environmental scarcity and overpopulation, and the rise of criminal anarchy, we are using language that Robert Kaplan brought into our homes. <br><br>In "Was Democracy Just a Moment?" Kaplan offers a fierce indictment of American plans to export democracy abroad, in places where it can't succeed. In "Idealism Won't Stop Mass Murder," he looks with a clear eye at the consequences of the new Holocaust mentality in American foreign policy. In "Proportionalism," he lays out boundaries for a successful policy toward the developing world. And in "The Dangers of Peace," he proposes a theory of war and peace in the modern world and a vision of the future of the United Nations that will be as controversial as "The Coming Anarchy" was when it first appeared in The Atlantic Monthly. <br><br>Impassioned, iconoclastic, visionary, and stubbornly original, The Coming Anarchy will be one of the most important and controversial books of the new century.</p><p>Robert Kaplan warns of a "bifurcated world divided between societies like ours, producing goods and services that the rest of the world wants, and those mired in various forms of chaos." This is a familiar theme for previous Kaplan readers (<i>Balkan Ghosts</i>, <i>The Ends of the Earth</i>). For those unacquainted with Kaplan, however, <i>The Coming Anarchy</i> is a fine introduction to one of the most important voices on the future of society and international relations. Kaplan mixes the intense reportage of a travel writer with the sharp wisdom of a foreign-policy expert to deliver what he calls "an unrelenting record of uncomfortable truths, of the kind that many of us implicitly acknowledge but will not publicly accept." <i>The Coming Anarchy</i> is also a disturbing book: Kaplan's vision of the future is a bleak one, full of ethnic conflict as the world falls away from a cold war that at least provided a kind of stability in even the shakiest of countries. That's gone now, of course, and Kaplan's descriptions of life and politics in Sierra Leone, Russia, India, and elsewhere are keenly troubling. Much of the book--but not all of it--has already seen print, mainly on the pages of <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> and <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>. It is brief in length but not in importance. <i>--John J. Miller</i>"Ambitiously eclectic".

Young William Bradford and his friends believed they had every right to belong to whichever church they wanted. In the name of religious freedom, they fled to Holland, then sailed to America to start a new life. But the winter was harsh, and before a year passed, half the settlers had died. Yet, through hard work and strong faith, a tough group of Pilgrims did survive. Their belief in freedom of religion became an American ideal that still lives on today.<br><br>James Daugherty draws on the Pilgrims' own journals to give a fresh and moving account of their life and traditions, their quest for religious freedom, and the founding of one of our nation's most beloved holidays�&#x20ac;&#x201d;Thanksgiving.</p><p>Born in 1889 in North Carolina, <b>James Henry Daugherty</b> studied art in Washington, DC, Philadelphia, and Europe.

Visit him at RickYancey.com.The Isle of Blood <br><br> <br>After several years of service to the monstrumologist, I approached him with the idea of recording, in the interest of posterity, one or two of his more memorable case studies. I waited, of course, until he was in one of his better moods. Approaching Pellinore Warthrop while he wallowed in one of his frequent bouts of melancholia could be hazardous to one&#x2019;s physical well-being. Once, when I made that ill-advised approach, he hurled a volume of Shakespeare&#x2019;s tragedies at my head.<br> <br>The moment presented itself at the delivery of the day&#x2019;s mail, which included a letter from President McKinley, thanking Warthrop for his service to the country upon the satisfactory conclusion of &#x201c;that peculiar incident in the Adirondacks.&#x201d; The doctor, whose ego was as robust as any of Mr. P. T. Barnum&#x2019;s sideshow strong men, read it aloud three times before entrusting it to my care. I was his file clerk, among other things&#x2014;or, I should say, as well as <i>every</i> other thing. Nothing outside his work could brighten the monstrumologist&#x2019;s mood more than a brush with celebrity. It seemed to satisfy some deep yearning in him.<br> <br>Beyond elevating his moribund spirits and thus ensuring&#x2014;momentarily, at least&#x2014;my physical safety, the letter also provided the perfect entr�e for my suggestion.<br> <br>&#x201c;It <i>was</i> quite peculiar, wasn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hmmm? Yes, I suppose.&#x201d; The monstrumologist was absorbed in the latest issue of the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i>, which had also arrived that day.<br> <br>&#x201c;It would make quite a tale, if someone were to tell it,&#x201d; I ventured.<br> <br>&#x201c;I have been thinking of preparing a small piece for the <i>Journal</i>,&#x201d; replied he. The <i>Journal of the Society for the Advancement of the Science of Monstrumology</i> was the official quarterly of the Society.<br> <br>&#x201c;I was thinking of something for more widespread consumption. A story for the <i>Post</i>, for example.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;An interesting idea, Will Henry,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But wholly impractical. I made a promise to the president that the matter would remain strictly confidential, and I&#x2019;ve no doubt that, if I should break my vow, I might find myself locked up in Fort Leavenworth, not exactly the ideal place to pursue my studies.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But if you published something in the <i>Journal</i>...&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, who reads <i>that</i>?&#x201d; he snorted, waving his hand dismissively. &#x201c;It is the nature of my profession, Will Henry, to labor in obscurity. I avoid the press for a very good reason, to protect the public <i>and</i> to protect my work. Imagine what the publication of that affair would do&#x2014;the firestorm of panic and recriminations. Why, half the state of New York would empty out, and the rest would appear on my doorstep to hang me from the nearest tree.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Some might say your actions were nothing short of heroic,&#x201d; I countered. If I could not appeal to his reason, I would plead to his ego.<br> <br>&#x201c;Some <i>have</i>,&#x201d; he replied, referring to the president&#x2019;s letter. &#x201c;And that must be enough.&#x201d;<br> <br>But not <i>quite</i> enough; I knew what he meant. More than once he had seized my hand at his bedside, staring beseechingly at me with those dark backlit eyes nearly mad with desperation and sorrow, begging me to never forget, to bear his memory past the grave. <i>You are all I have, Will Henry. Who else will remember me when I am gone? I will sink into oblivion, and the earth shall not note or care at my passing!</i><br> <br>&#x201c;Very well. Another case, then. That matter in Campeche, at Calakmul...&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What is this, Will Henry?&#x201d; He glared at me over the magazine. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you see I am trying to relax?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Holmes has his Watson.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Holmes is a fictional character,&#x201d; he pointed out.<br> <br>&#x201c;But he is based on someone real.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah.&#x201d; He was smiling slyly at me. &#x201c;William James Henry, do you have literary ambitions? I am astounded.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That I might have literary ambitions?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That you have any ambition at all.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; I said, taking a deep breath. &#x201c;I do.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And all this time I had allowed myself to hope you might follow in my footsteps as a student of aberrant biology.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why couldn&#x2019;t I be both?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Doyle is a physician.&#x201d;<br> <br><i>&#x201c;Was,&#x201d;</i> he corrected me. &#x201c;And not a very successful one at that.&#x201d; He laid down the magazine. I had at last gotten his full attention. &#x201c;I will confess the idea intrigues me, and I would have no objection to your trying your hand at it, but I retain the right to review anything you set to paper. Beyond my own reputation, I have the legacy of my profession to protect.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; I said eagerly. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t dream of publishing anything without obtaining your approval first.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But nothing of our difficulties in the Adirondacks.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I was actually thinking of that case from a few years ago&#x2014;the incident in Socotra.&#x201d;<br> <br>His face darkened. His eyes burned. He leveled a finger at my face and said, &#x201c;Absolutely not. Do you understand? Under no circumstances are you <i>ever</i> to do such a thing. The temerity, Will Henry, to even suggest it!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But why, Dr. Warthrop?&#x201d; I asked, taken aback by the ferocity of his reaction.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know very well the answer to that question. Oh, I should have guessed it. I should have known!&#x201d; He rose from his chair, shaking with the force of his passion. &#x201c;I see it now, the true fount of your ambition, Mr. Henry! You would not immortalize but humiliate and degrade!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Dr. Warthrop, I would do nothing of the kind&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then, I ask you, of all the cases we have investigated, why did you choose the one that casts me in the worst possible light? Ha! See, I have caught you. There is only one reasonable answer to that question. Revenge!&#x201d;<br> <br>I could not hide my astonishment at his accusation. &#x201c;Revenge? Revenge for what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For your perceived mistreatment, of course.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why do you think I have been mistreated?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, that is very clever of you, Will Henry&#x2014;parsing my words to mask your perfidy. I did not confess to mistreating you; I pointed out your <i>perception</i> of mistreatment.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Very well,&#x201d; I said. There were very few arguments anyone could win with him. In fact, I had never won <i>any</i>. &#x201c;You pick the case.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t <i>wish</i> to pick the case! The entire idea was yours to begin with. But you&#x2019;ve shown your hand in this, and rest assured I will disavow anything you dare to publish under the guise of preserving my legacy. Holmes had his Watson, indeed! And Caesar had his Brutus, didn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I would never do anything to betray you,&#x201d; I said evenly. &#x201c;I suggested Socotra because I thought&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; he cried, taking a step toward me. I flinched as if expecting a blow, though in all our years together he had never struck me. &#x201c;I forbid it! I have labored too long and too hard to banish the memory of that accursed place from my mind. You are never to speak that name again in my presence, do you understand? Never again!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;As you wish, Doctor,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I shall never speak of it again.&#x201d;<br> <br>And I didn&#x2019;t. I dropped the matter and never brought it up again until now. It would be extremely difficult&#x2014;no, impossible&#x2014;to immortalize someone who denied the very facts reported. Years passed, and as his powers waned with them, my duties expanded to include the composition of his papers and letters. I took no credit for my efforts and received none from the monstrumologist. He ferociously edited my work, striking out anything that, in his opinion, smacked of poetic indulgence. In science, he told me, there is no room for romantic discourse or ruminations upon the nature of evil. That he himself was a poet in his youth drenched the exercise in irony and pathos.<br> <br>It has often puzzled me, what pleasure he derived from denying himself those very things that gave him pleasure. But I am not the first to point out that love is a complicated thing. It is true the monstrumologist loved his work&#x2014;it was, besides me, all he had&#x2014;but his work was merely an extension of himself, the firstborn fruit of his towering ambition. His work may have brought him to that strange and accursed island, but it was his ambition that nearly undid him.<br> <br>It began on a freezing February night in 1889 with the arrival of a package to the house on Harrington Lane. The delivery was unexpected but not unusual. Having been an apprentice to the monstrumologist for almost three years, I was accustomed to the midnight knock upon the back door, the furtive exchange of the portage charge, and the doctor acting like a boy on Christmas morn, his cheeks ablaze with feverish anticipation as he bore his present to the basement laboratory, where the box was unwrapped and its foul contents revealed in all their macabre glory. What was unusual about this particular delivery was the man who brought it. In the course of my service to the monstrumologist, I had seen my fair share of unsavory characters, men who, for a dollar and a dram of whiskey, would sell their own mothers&#x2014;willing mercenaries in service to the natural science of aberrant biology.<br> <br>But this was not the sort who stood shivering in the alleyway. Though bedraggled from a journey of many miles, he wore an expensive fur-lined coat that hung open to reveal a tailored suit. A diamond ring glittered on the little finger of his left hand. More striking than his regalia was his manner; the poor fellow seemed nearly mad with panic. He abandoned his cargo on the back stoop, pushed his way into the room, seized the doctor by his lapels, and demanded to know if this was number 425 Harrington Lane and if he&#x2014;the doctor&#x2014;was Pellinore Warthrop.<br> <br>&#x201c;I am Dr. Warthrop,&#x201d; said my master.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, thank God! Thank God!&#x201d; the tormented man cried in a hoarse voice. &#x201c;Now I&#x2019;ve done it. It&#x2019;s right out there. Take it, take it. I&#x2019;ve brought you the blasted thing. Now give it to me! He said you would&#x2014;he said you had it. Quickly, before it&#x2019;s too late!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My good man,&#x201d; replied the doctor calmly. &#x201c;I would gladly pay the charge, if the price is reasonable.&#x201d; Though he was a man of substantial means, the monstrumologist&#x2019;s parsimony soared to near operatic heights.<br> <br>&#x201c;The price? The price!&#x201d; The man laughed hysterically. &#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t you who&#x2019;ll pay, Warthrop! He said you had it. He promised you would give it to me if I brought it. Now keep his promise!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Whose promise?&#x201d;<br> <br>Our uninvited guest let loose a banshee howl and doubled over, clutching his chest. His eyes rolled back into his head. The doctor caught him before he hit the floor, and eased him into a chair.<br> <br>&#x201c;Damn him to hell&#x2014;too late!&#x201d; the man whimpered. &#x201c;I am too late!&#x201d; He wrung his hands in supplication. &#x201c;Am I too late, Dr. Warthrop?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I cannot answer that question,&#x201d; replied the doctor. &#x201c;For I have no idea what you&#x2019;re talking about.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He told me you would give me the antidote if I brought it, but I was delayed in New York. I missed the train and had to wait for the next one&#x2014;more than two hours I had to wait. Oh, God! To come all this way only to die at the end of it!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The antidote? The antidote to what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;To the poison! &#x2018;Bring my little gift to Warthrop in America if you wish to live,&#x2019; he told me, the devil, the fiend! So I have, and so you <i>must</i>. Ah, but it is hopeless. I feel it now&#x2014;my heart&#x2014;my heart&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>The doctor shook his head sharply and with a snap of his fingers directed me to fetch his instrument case.<br> <br>&#x201c;I will do all within my power,&#x201d; I heard him say to the poor man as I scampered off. &#x201c;But you must get a grip on yourself and tell me simply and plainly...&#x201d;<br> <br>Our tormented courier had fallen into a swoon by the time I returned, eyes rolling in his head, hands twitching in his lap. His face had drained of all color. The doctor removed the stethoscope from the case and listened to the man&#x2019;s heart, bending low over the quivering form, his legs spread wide for balance.<br> <br>&#x201c;Galloping like a runaway horse, Will Henry,&#x201d; the monstrumologist murmured. &#x201c;But no abnormalities or irregularities that I can detect. Quickly, a glass of water.&#x201d;<br> <br>I expected him to offer the distressed man a drink; instead Warthrop dumped the entire contents of the glass over his head. The man&#x2019;s eyes snapped open. The mouth formed a startled <i>O</i>.<br> <br>&#x201c;What sort of poison did he give you?&#x201d; demanded my master in a stern voice. &#x201c;Did he say? Answer!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tip... tipota... from the pyrite tree.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tipota?&#x201d; The doctor frowned. &#x201c;From what kind of tree?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Pyrite! Tipota, from the pyrite tree of the Isle of Demons!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The Isle of Demons! But that is... extraordinary. Are you quite certain?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Bloody hell. I think I would remember what he poisoned me with!&#x201d; the man sputtered vehemently. &#x201c;And he said <i>you</i> had the antidote! Oh! Oh! This is it!&#x201d; His hands clawed at his chest. &#x201c;My heart is exploding!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so,&#x201d; said the doctor slowly. He stepped back, studying the man carefully, dark eyes dancing with that eerie backlit fire. &#x201c;We still have a few moments... but only a few! Will Henry, stay with our guest while I mix up the antidote.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then, I am not too late?&#x201d; the man inquired incredulously, as if he could not dare to allow himself to hope.<br> <br>&#x201c;When was the poison administered?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;On the evening of the second.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of this month?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, yes&#x2014;of course this month! I would be as dead as a doornail if it had been last month, now, wouldn&#x2019;t I!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, forgive me. Tipota is slow-acting, but not quite <i>that</i> slow-acting! I shall be back momentarily. Will Henry, call me at once should our friend&#x2019;s condition change.&#x201d;<br> <br>The doctor flew down the stairs to the basement, leaving the door slightly ajar. We could hear jars knocking against each other, the clink and clang of metal, the hiss of a Bunsen burner.<br> <br>&#x201c;What if he&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; the man moaned. &#x201c;What if it is too late? My eyesight is failing&#x2014;that&#x2019;s what goes just before the end! You go blind and your heart blows apart&#x2014;blows completely apart inside your chest. Your face, child. I cannot see your face! It is lost to the darkness. The darkness comes! Oh, may he burn for all eternity in the lowest circle of the pit&#x2014;the devil&#x2014;the fiend!&#x201d;<br> <br>The doctor bounded back into the room, carrying a syringe loaded with an olive-green-colored liquid. The dying man jerked in the chair upon the doctor&#x2019;s entrance and cried out, &#x201c;Who is that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It is I, Warthrop,&#x201d; answered the doctor. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get that coat off. Will Henry, help him, please.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You have the antidote?&#x201d; the man asked.<br> <br>The doctor nodded curtly, pulled up the man&#x2019;s sleeve, and jabbed the needle home.<br> <br>&#x201c;There now!&#x201d; Warthrop said. &#x201c;The stethoscope, Will Henry. Thank you.&#x201d; He listened to the man&#x2019;s heart for a few seconds, and I thought it must be a trick of the light, for I spied what appeared to be a smile playing on the doctor&#x2019;s lips. &#x201c;Yes. Slowing considerably. How do you feel?&#x201d;<br> <br>A bit of color had returned to the man&#x2019;s cheeks, and his breathing had slowed. Whatever the doctor had given him was having a salutary effect. He spoke hesitantly, as if he could hardly believe his good fortune. &#x201c;Better, I think. My eyesight is clearing a bit.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good! You may be relieved to know that...,&#x201d; the monstrumologist began, and then stopped himself. It had occurred to him, perhaps, that the man had already suffered enough distress. &#x201c;It is a very dangerous poison. Always fatal, slow-acting, and symptom-free until the end, but its effects are entirely reversible if the antidote is administered in time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He said you would know what to do.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m quite certain he did. Tell me, how did you come by the acquaintance ...</p><h2>No Man Is an Island (Shambhala Library)</h2><p>Here, in one of his most popular of his more than thirty books, Thomas Merton provides further meditations on the spiritual life in sixteen thoughtful essays, beginning with his classic treatise "Love Can Be Kept Only by Being Given Away." This sequel to <i>Seeds of Contemplation </i> provides fresh insight into Merton's favorite topics of silence and solitude, while also underscoring the importance of community and the deep connectedness to others that is the inevitable basis of the spiritual life&#x2014;whether one lives in solitude or in the midst of a crowd.</p><p>Thomas Merton (1915&#x2013;1968) was a Trappist monk, spiritual director, political activist, social critic, and one of the most-read spiritual writers of the twentieth century. He is the author of many books, including <i>The Seven Storey Mountain</i>.Jonathan Montaldo interprets Merton's work on enduring values, fulfillment, salvation, and the relationship between faith and human spirituality. Montaldo conveys complex ideas with simplicity and an impeccable delivery. The first essay on spiritual love is considered a classic. Montaldo gives a polished performance when he reflects on man's relationship with God, man's relationship with others, and why love can only be kept when it is given away. Other themes touch on hope, conscience, freedom, and prayer. Montaldo's delivery of Merton's material on Christian humanism and reciprocal love gives the listener food for thought. This well-done series of spiritual meditations provides a wellspring of enlightenment and encouragement. Fans of Thomas Merton will enjoy the flowing prose.

They save our lives, enabling quick action in emergencies. Yet how we behave when we are emotional can make our lives, and the lives of those we care about, miserable. Without emotions there would be no heroism, empathy, or compassion, but neither would there be cruelty, selfishness, nor spite. Bringing different perspectives to bear&#x2014;Eastern and Western, spirituality and science, Buddhism and psychology&#x2014;the Dalai Lama and I sought to clarify these contradictions and illuminate some paths that might enable a balanced emotional life and a feeling of compassion that can reach across the globe.</p><p></p><p></p><p>As the leader of a millennia-old spiritual tradition as well as a nation in exile, the Dalai Lama holds something resembling divine status among his fellow Tibetans. He is the world&#x2019;s principal living advocate of nonviolence and the winner, in 1989, of the Nobel Peace Prize and, in 2007, of the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest award given to a civilian by the U.S. government. He is denounced and at times publicly despised by the leaders of the People&#x2019;s Republic of China, which has occupied Tibet since 1950. Yet he is also more than a religious and political leader: In the Western world his celebrity approaches that of a rock star. He has authored several best selling books and is nearly always traveling, speaking, and inspiring audiences that number in the thousands. He is also strongly interested in integrating the findings of modern science into the Buddhist world view. In our conversations, it became clear to me that he considers himself first and foremost a Buddhist monk and an interpreter of Buddhist thinking to the rest of the world. He believes that Buddhist wisdom provides an ethical framework through which the world might be able to better deal with the problems that divide us.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I am a professor emeritus at the University of California-San Francisco School of Medicine, having spent more than forty years establishing the universality of humans&#x2019; emotional behavior, mapping the expressions of the face, discovering how lies are betrayed in our demeanor, and proposing theories to explain both the nature of emotion and why and when people lie. This research has helped to reawaken scientific interest in both emotion and deception. I am the author or editor of fourteen books, five of them&#x2014;</p><p><em>Unmasking the Face, Face of Man, Telling Lies, Why Kids Lie,</em></p><p>and </p><p><em>Emotions Revealed</em></p><p>&#x2014;written for the general public, and over my career I have become an expert on Charles Darwin&#x2019;s writings on emotional expression. My work has been of interest to a wide range of organizations, from animation studios to police departments, and I now run a business that designs interactive training tools for improving emotional understanding and evaluating truthfulness. I also advise several governments&#x2019; antiterrorism agencies. I am Jewish in background but not observant, and as skeptical about Buddhism as I am about any religion. I have spent my life as a behavioral </p><p><em>scientist</em></p><p>, developing and applying hard, objective methods to the investigation of what had been considered the soft phenomenon of emotion.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Despite our differences, we discovered important common ground in our perspectives. We share a commitment to reducing human suffering, intense inquisitiveness, and a conviction that we were likely to learn from each other. Our conversations reveal the unfolding of what developed into an intense friendship over the course of the nearly forty hours we spent exploring these issues. Our common concerns for personal and social welfare, borne from decades of thought and work in the most contrasting of conditions, united our efforts and brought forth new ideas, new ways to understand ourselves, practical steps for creating better worlds, in our closest and most distant relationships.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I first met the Dalai Lama in 2000, when I attended a small conference on destructive emotions organized by the Mind and Life Institute, in Boulder, Colorado.1 Since 1987, the institute has brought scientists to Dharamsala, India, where the Dalai Lama lives in exile, for conferences on diverse scientific topics. At the 2000 conference I was one of six scientist-participants who talked with the Dalai Lama over five days. My responsibility was to present the Darwinian view of emotion and to explain my scientific research on the universality of emotional expression and physiology. Whether through a shared sense of playful and probing curiosity, our commitment to reducing human suffering, or a conviction that we were likely to learn from each other, the Dalai Lama and I immediately found an unexpectedly strong rapport across the wide gulf of the intellectual heritages we each represent.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In the following few years, I participated as one of a group of scientists in three other conferences with the Dalai Lama. In addition, I was in the audience at a panel session, " Opening the Heart, " that was held in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 2004, in which the Dalai Lama was one of a number of religious leaders in attendance. One by one, the spiritual leaders addressed the group: Bishop Desmond Tutu talked about how his religion had helped him open his heart; Dr. Jo-Ann Archibald, a Northwest American Indian, talked about how her religion had opened her heart; the Iranian justice Shirin Ebadi and then Rabbi Zalman Schachter- Shalomi each spoke about how their religions had opened their hearts. His Holiness was the last to speak.* He looked around at each of the individuals who had preceded him and, with a broad smile on his face, said something like, "But religions often divide the world. What unifies us are our emotions. We all want to have happiness and reduce suffering." I thought to myself, exactly right&#x2014;but our emotions also divide us.</p><p></p><p></p><p>When I left the Vancouver meeting, my mind was filled with the issues about the nature of emotion that had been raised by the Dalai Lama&#x2019;s remarks, issues that I thought merited exploration. He was right in saying emotions are what we had in common, but he had left out all the ways in which our emotions can separate us, and cause us to have conflicts with one another. I was concerned that perhaps I had oversimplified matters in my presentation about emotions four years earlier. I began a list of the unexplored questions, some of them focusing on how humanity might be able to reduce the divisions among us through the unifying nature of our emotions, others on how to decrease the destructive influence emotions can bring into our lives. My initial outline came to twenty pages.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Motivated by the sense that, coming from our distinct traditions of Western psychology and Buddhist philosophy, a back-and forth discussion could spark between us new ideas, I sought the opinions of two colleagues I had met at the Mind and Life Institute conference in 2000. One was Matthieu Ricard. Matthieu received his doctorate in biology in 1972 and then chose to leave the academic world, becoming a Tibetan Buddhist monk and a renowned author and photographer.2 He has resided at the Shechen</p><p></p><p></p><p>________________________</p><p></p><p></p><p>* I was told the honorific "His Holiness" was adopted for addressing the Dalai Lama when he leaves the home of the government in exile in Dharamsala to represent the Tibetan cause around the world since the Tibetan term for addressing him is very long and cumbersome; "His Holiness" was adopted because it is how the pope, the head of another world religion, is addressed. I rarely used the honorific in our conversations as, being nonreligious myself, I view him as an extraordinary person but not a holy one.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Monastery in Nepal for more than thirty years and has served as a French translator for the Dal</p></p><h2>Beyond A Boundary</h2><p>In C. L. R. James's classic <i>Beyond a Boundary,</i> the sport is cricket and the scene is the colonial West Indies. Always eloquent and provocative, James--the "black Plato," (as coined by the London <i>Times</i>)--shows us how, in the rituals of performance and conflict on the field, we are watching not just prowess but politics and psychology at play. Part memoir of a boyhood in a black colony (by one of the founding fathers of African nationalism), part passionate celebration of an unusual and unexpected game, <i>Beyond a Boundary</i> raises, in a warm and witty voice, serious questions about race, class, politics, and the facts of colonial oppression. Originally published in England in 1963 and in the United States twenty years later (Pantheon, 1983), this second American edition brings back into print this prophetic statement on race and sport in society.</p><p><p>C.

In a face-off between Rob Lowe and Louise Brooks, who has the most glamorous jaw line?

Each reproduction has an embellishment that adds visual interest and texture. The text invites readers to start with one of Monet's White Waterlilies (1899) and end with nine boys depicted in Winslow Homer's Snap the Whip (1872). Most of the art represents the work of European impressionists and post-impressionists. The counting is challenging enough to engage the intended audience, as every item is not immediately apparent. The additions such as ribbon or sandpaper have varying degrees of success, at times detracting from the artwork as with van Gogh's Fishing Boats on the Beach (1888). In King Henry, European paintings are used to tell a story about a dragon out to steal the royal jewels. Children will enjoy the suspense and be pleased to find that the dragon hasn't stolen a thing. From King Henry's glittery chain (a ribbon added to Portrait of Henry VIII by Hans Holbein the Younger, 1540) to the knight's shiny armor (silver paper added to Portrait of a Knight by Vittore Carpaccio, 1510), all the treasures are safe. While these board books tap into the trend of introducing young children to fine art, they have a safety warning stating that small parts make them suitable for ages three and up&#x2013;something to consider for collections that attract younger users.

Feast is not just about the way we cook and eat at the great religious festivals or big- deal special occasions, but about how food is the vital way we celebrate anything that matters...it&#39;s how we mark the connections between us, how we celebrate life.&#39;Essentially about families and food, about public holidays and private passions, about how to celebrate the small everyday pleasures as well as the big occasions, it includes everything from Christmas, Thanksgiving , Hanukkah and Eid, to Passover and Easter; from Valentine&#39;s Day to that first breakfast in bed and Sunday lunch fit for the In-Laws; from Meatless Feasts to Midnight Feasts, from Partytime to the ultimate Chocolate Cake Hall of Fame; from weddings to funerals, from Georgian and Venetian feasts to children&#39;s favourites. Heartwarming, passionate, informed, refreshingly uncomplicated and full of ideas, Feast is destined to become a classic like How to Eat. Written with the same enjoyment, sensuality and practical awareness, and packed with over 300 recipes from all over the world and from near to home, Feast proclaims Nigella&#39;s love of life and great food to celebrate it with.</p><p>If you consider eating with friends and family a joyful, indulgent celebration chances are you love a good feast. And who better to carefully guide you through the daunting task of preparing that <i>Feast</i> than the domestic goddess herself Nigella Lawson. Written in the tradition of <i>Nigella Bites</i> and <i>How to Eat</i>, <i>Feast</i> is a cookbook for the sensualist that wants to eat very well, but also wants to spend time enjoying the company of their guests instead of struggling with the creation of the meal. What sets Lawson apart is not that she's a good cookbook writer, but a strong writer period. Similar to her other books, Nigella's <i>Feast</i> is presented as part personal memoir, part educational, and part recipe presentation. There is a nice blend of occasions including the obvious (Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's, and Easter), a few culturally specific ones (Rosh Hashanah, Georgian Feast, and Venetian Feast), feasts for kids, for vegetarians, and an elegant cocktail party. Each chapter begins with an overview of that particular "Feast." Generally, there is a personal story and experience told, an overview of the cultural importance of the feast, and a description of foods that are associated with each occasion. Impressively, every recipe begins with a personal anecdote giving that impression Nigella didn't just throw it in the book, but is experienced with the recipe and has used it with success. Take her twist on the decadent Chocolate Guinness Cake for example: "I wanted to make a cream cheese frosting to echo the pale head that sits on top of a glass of stout. It's unconventional to add cream but it makes it frothier and lighter which I regard as aesthetically and gastronomically desirable." Who can argue? The cake is to die for. So next time you need to prepare a dinner party let the goddess be your guide, and remember: Keep the preparation simple, use easily available ingredients, and take time to enjoy your guests and your meal. <i>Feast</i> may not be the most advanced cookbook you will own, but if you want to create excellent food with relative ease in a short amount of time, you can not beat Nigella. <i>--Rob Bracco</i>Nigella Lawson is the author of bestselling books - How to Eat (&#39;may just be the best cookery book ever&#39; Daily Telegraph), How to be a Domestic Goddess (British Book Awards 2001), Nigella Bites (WHSmith Award 2002) Forever Summer (&#39;images of warmth and Mediterranean climes&#39; Time Out), Feast, (&#39;a voluptuous and delicious piece of food writing&#39; Guardian), Nigella Express (no. 1 bestseller with over 1 million sales), Nigella Christmas (&#39;everything to make your Christmas sparkle&#39; Independent) and Nigellissima - which, together with her successful TV series and her recent iPhone App, Nigella Quick Collection, have made hers a household name around the world.

This fresh look at a classic is a great book for any quilter!<br><br> (<i>quiltmag.com, 10/01/12</i>)<br><br>Tacha has outdone herself on her Hexagon English Paper Piecing book. One of my favorite quilts in the book is a huge Union Jack quilt. This is just one example of the happy, colorful projects in the book.<br><br>Is Happy a color? It should be. If my unmade bed looked this good, I would never make it again.<br> (<i>modalissa.blogspot.com, 09/25/12</i>)<br><br>As you may have guessed from the title, Hexa-Go-Go is all about projects featuring hexagons! Never tackled hexagons (or, as many quilters like to call them, "hexies") before? Have no fear. For the uninitiated, Tacha begins the book with a robust, 15-page section that takes the reader step-by-step through the process of English Paper Piecing. For more experienced paper piecers, the book contains a variety of projects that are sure to inspire sewists to put their hexagons to use in fresh, unique ways.This is Tacha's first book but, based on the high quality of Hexa-Go-Go, I predict it won't be her last. Tacha is an amazing quilter and crafter, and both her style and skill are presented beautifully in this book. Tacha is one of those talented crafters whose fabric choices and original patterns reflect the eye of a modern quilter, but who simultaneously pays homage to the history and traditions of quilting. The result is a beautiful book that is sure to become a classic! I've made no secret of my (ahem) distaste for hand sewing. Little did I know that my first attempt at the technique&#x2014;a quilting bee block for Tacha that I made years ago&#x2014;would actually make its way into a book! See the quilt above? Tacha included blocks made by several members of the Bee Inspired quilting bee into the original Over the Rainbow quilt pattern.<br><br> (<i>quiltdad.com, 10/03/12</i>)<br><br>I think it's always exciting to learn a new technique, and I can happily say that Hexa Go-Go taught me how to do English paper piecing with hexagons. Like so many of us, I've been seeing the gorgeous EPP projects on Flickr for years, but I hadn't attempted it until now. The how-to instructions in Hexa Go-Go are straightforward and comprehensive. My favorite thing about Tacha's Getting Started With Hexagons chapter is that she describes multiple ways of completing certain steps, along with pros and cons of the different methods. After reading this chapter, I felt like I knew exactly what supplies I needed and how to use them. I kept the book with me while I was practicing and found myself referring back to it several times, each time finding exactly the information I was looking for.<br> (<i>ohfransson.com, 10/0312</i>)<br><br>Tacha Bruecher is the latest quilt author to have been swept up in the current craze for English paper piecing (EPP). She says that her enthusiasm for EPP caught her by surprise, as she is an impatient person by nature. But, having tried it, she was hooked. It's therapeutic and, because it's so portable, she declares it 'quilting's answer to knitting!' Even if you're mainly a machine stitcher, Tacha encourages you to try EPP because it will increase your quilting time&#x2014;you'll be able to pull a few hexagons out of your handbag and work on them any time, and before long, you'll have a whole block done. What's more, EPP allows quiltmakers to confidently tackle complex projects, knowing that points and corners will all match up. What makes Tacha's book different and worth buying is that she has added a modern twist&#x2014;with wonky piecing, white sashing, embroidery, raw-edge applique and a colour palette and fabric choices that scream 'modern.' <br> (<i>Australian Homespun Magazine, January 2013</i>)</p><h2>My Anecdotal Life</h2><p>More than once, Carl Reiner has had friends say, &#x201c;Hey, Reiner, you ought to write those things down.&#x201d; And at eighty, he finally has. <br><br>In this funny and engaging memoir, one of the best raconteurs on the planet recalls his life in show business in short comic takes.

The jockish Marble was the mascot of a San Francisco baseball team until her brother gave her a tennis racquet and she found her true gift. Under the tutelage of Teach Tennant, coach to the stars, Marble became a national-caliber player, but on a trip to Europe, she collapsed on the court. She was diagnosed as suffering from TB and told she would never play again. But encouraged by Teach and another of Teach's pupils, Carole Lombard, Marble learned to walk, then play, again. She went on to win Forest Hills in 1936, and then, after a long losing streak, hit her stride in the late Thirties, winning all the major titles in both singles and doubles until the advent of WW II put an end to the competitive tennis circuit. Her first romance, with a dashing Swiss banker named Hans, ended in disaster when Teach insisted that love and tennis couldn't mix. Marble was approached by US Army Intelligence and asked to go to Switzerland, where perhaps she could reconnect with her old beau Hans, suspected of aiding the Nazis in hiding their wealth. She went to teach clinics in Geneva and, sure enough, Hans contacted her; within days, she moved into his chateau. Best of luck, he drunkenly told her not only about the treasure in his vault, but where the key was hidden. She sneaked into the vault, photographed the conveniently available ledgers, and escaped--after a car chase and a shootout. Marble, who died last year, has brought lots of mildly diverting incident into play, but it all adds up to little in the way of insight, gossip, or historical flavor. (Sixteen pages of b&amp;w photos--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Marble, who died earlier this year, is probably not well known today, but in international tennis and social circles of the 1930s, she was in demand. She was the top-ranked female tennis player in America from 1936-1940, winning five Wimbledon and 12 U.S. Open titles in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles. Her public life was filled with success. However, her private life was another matter. Fatherless at six, raped at 15, and diagnosed with tuberculosis at 19 right at the threshold of her tennis career, Marble thought she had finally found happiness with her marriage and pregnancy. But within months of one another, she miscarried due to an auto accident and lost her husband in World War II. Amazingly undaunted, Marble used this loss to spur herself into spying for the U.S. Army, seeking out a past lover in order to learn the names of high-ranking Nazis. The anecdotes will satisfy celebrity gossip mavens; Marble's hair-raising exploits as a spy will please those who like Countess Aline and Beryl Markham; and the inherent melodrama of this remarkable woman's life will lure lovers of romance. This is lots of fun; and take note, Jessica Lange and Farrah Fawcett are among the actresses trying to obtain the film rights.<br><i>- Rosellen Brewer, Monterey Cty.

Not Harold's idea of fun. Too many mosquitoes, ticks and cockleburs. But when the Monroe family set out, their faithful dog Harold was with them, mostly because he remembered that camping could also bring s'mores and toasted marshmallows. Howie, the other family dog, and Chester the cat were also included in the trip. Only Chester thought the idea was completely insane. The woods, he informed Harold, were not only full of cockleburs and ticks, but of spirits, evil spirits who prey on the innocent. And on this, the worst night of the year -- St. George's Eve, when all spirits are set loose -- who knew what could happen. <p>What Harold knew was that Chester was a well read, over-stimulated cat, full of weird ideas. He did not take Chester's worries too seriously. He had s'more to think about. But then, the Monroes set up camp near two strange men and their even stranger dog, and things began to happen that made even Harold wonder. Could Chester be right? </p><p>This begins a long night, full of terrors and alarms, full of Chester's horrifying tale of how Bunnicula, the vampire bunny, was born and came to America, full of storms and a total sense of danger; and at the end came surprises that even Chester could not have predicted. </p><p>Once again, the Monroe family may be the victims of evil forces or only of Chester's strange imagination.

Clarke's unique approach to building self-esteem begins with her belief that this is indeed a "family affair." Rather than offering collection of dictatorial "shoulds," <i>Self-Esteem: A Family Affair</i> instead serves as a source of parental support, providing a broad range of imaginative and effective suggestions for dealing with individual family members in ways that nourish self-esteem for all involved.<p>Throughout her book, Clarke encourages parents to claim their strengths and to trust their judgment as they make decisions about appropriate child care. Recognizing, too, that kids' needs are best met by adults whose own needs have not been neglected, Clarke offers a range of creative and workable options for parents to build the self-esteem of children while also caring for their emotional needs.</p><p>Jean Illsley Clarke, author of Hazelden's <i>Growing Up Again: Parenting Ourselves, Parenting Our Children,</i> is a writer and an internationally recognized parent educator who specializes in the areas of parenting, self-esteem, family dynamics, and adult children of alcoholics.

To accomplish these ends, this book carefully defines parental accountability, authority, and responsibility. The book also describes the nature of a child and explains the biblically defined states of development. With these principles firmly established, this book presents a biblical system for rearing children.</p><p>The following comments by the author are not intended to help sell his book, merely to give his opinion as to why this particular book has such complete opposite for and against reviews.You will readily see that the reviews on this book are extremely polarized between those who LOVE the book (5 stars) because it is faithful to the Bible and those who HATE it for the same reason. This should come as no surprise since Christ warned Christians that they should: "Beware lest anyone cheat you through philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the basic principles of the world, and not according to Christ." (Colossians 2:8) <p>Those who follow God's Word are warned in 1 John 3:13: "Do not marvel, my brethren, if the world hates you." Those who reject God's Word speak from their knowledge of the world philosophies (psychology and false religion) because: "They are of the world. Therefore they speak as of the world, and the world hears them. We are of God. He who knows God hears us; he who is not of God does not hear us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error." (1 John 4:5-6) </p> <p>Of course, some emotional or untaught Christians may also be deceived by these false philosophies and are thus warned in Colossians 2:8 to: "Beware lest anyone cheat you through philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the basic principles of the world, and not according to Christ." The consequences for these believers is graphically described in 2 Peter 2:18-22.</p></p><h2>Secrecy World: Inside the Panama Papers Investigation of Illicit Money Networks and the Global Elite</h2><p><p><b>A two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist takes us inside the world revealed by the Panama Papers, a landscape of illicit money, political corruption, and fraud on a global scale. </b></p><p>A hidden circulatory system flows beneath the surface of global finance, carrying trillions of dollars from drug trafficking, tax evasion, bribery, and other illegal enterprises.

Aaron, whose founding of the Isralight Institute in Jerusalem helped establish him as one of today's most popular spirituality gurus, writes in a crisp, clear style that offers eminently practical advice for those who wish to see God in their daily lives. The book's first chapter, "Getting Rid of God," does away with "the male, Zeus-like avenger floating about in heaven," which Aaron calls "a childish and counterproductive" concept. In place of "God," Aaron offers <i>Hashem</i>, a Hebrew term that means "the name," which stands for "Ultimate Reality Who embraces everything and fills everything"--a theological and lexical shift that emphasizes divine immanence in the world. <i>Seeing God</i> then elaborates 10 qualities of Hashem, derived from the Kabbalah, the ancient Jewish mystical text. Readers are encouraged to acknowledge and emulate these qualities, which range from <i>Gevurah</i> (kindness) to <i>Malhut</i> (communal consciousness). Each chapter concludes with "Seeing Exercises" and questions for contemplation ("Can you think of three things that you have done to bring justice into the world?"), whose purpose is to demonstrate that "Hashem is right here, right now, waiting to be seen, wanting to be known." <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>A recognized expert on the Kabbalah, Rabbi David Aaron is the founder and dean of the Isralight Institute, an international organization with centers in Israel and the United States. He travels throughout the world lecturing, leading retreats, and making media appearances on major programs, such as <i>Larry King Live</i>.

Each of his books is vastly different in its content, design, and illustrations but one aspect remains constant throughout his work: his passion about his subjects. Rumford, a resident of Hawaii, has studied more than a dozen languages and worked in the Peace Corps, where he traveled to Africa, Asia, and Afghanistan. He draws from these experiences and the history of his subject when he is working on a book. His book Sequoyah: The Cherokee Man Who Gave His People Writing was a 2005 Sibert Honor winner.Gr 3-6-"In the days when the earth was flat and Jerusalem was the center of the world, there was a boy named Ibn Battuta." So begins this introduction to the journeys of this historically important but probably little-known, 14th-century Muslim figure. Born in Morocco and raised as a scholar, he began his 29 years of travel in 1325 when, "At twenty-one, he decided to go to Mecca as a pilgrim." He went on through Africa, across the steppes of Asia, into India and China, and back to Morocco where "he told his story to the Moroccan court secretary Ibn Juzayy, who wrote it down in Arabic." Rumford's simply written adaptation is often surprisingly eloquent. For example, Ibn Battuta comments on his voyage: "Traveling-it leaves you speechless, then turns you into a storyteller." "Traveling-it had captured my heart, and now my heart was calling me home." On each page, a portion of the text appears within its own bright white narrow road crossing elegantly bordered illustrations that shine with generous amounts of gold, red, and deep blue. This text also flows into and out of larger frames. The artist adorns many of these illustrations with Arabic and Chinese calligraphy, providing translations for the longer phrases at the end of the book. A few maps are included and they are executed with the same attention to presentation. A glossary of names, places, and important words provides essential information in an accessible format. Simply put, this is a beautifully crafted work that will undoubtedly spark interest and encourage further study.<p></p><p><i>Alicia Eames, New York City Public Schools</i></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Catwoman Vol. 4: Gotham Underground (The New 52)</h2><p>After being robbed time and time again by Catwoman, Gotham City crime lord the Penguin has decided to wage war against the thieving anti-hero.

Bentley was born in 1875 and educated at St Paul&#39;s School, London, where he met eminent critic and author G K Chesterton, who became his closest friend. Bentley began a lifelong career in journalism in 1902, working for ten years on the editorial staff of the Daily News and for a further twenty years on the Daily Telegraph. In 1905, he published Biography for Beginners (under the pseudonym E Clerihew), which was a volume of nonsense verse consisting of four-lines and called &#39;clerihews&#39; (in his honour), which became as popular as the limerick form. Two further volumes followed in 1929 and 1939. Bentley&#39;s masterpiece, Trent&#39;s Last Case (1913), was written in exasperation at the infallibility of Sherlock Holmes and marked the beginning of a new era in detective fiction. Indeed, it has long been hailed as marking the start of the &#39;Golden Age of Crime Fiction&#39; and the first truly modern mystery. The sequel, Trent&#39;s Own Case, did not appear for a further twenty three years and this was then followed by a book of short stories; Trent Intervenes. Of Trent&#39;s Last Case Agatha Christie wrote: &#39;One of the three bes detective stories ever written&#39;, whilst Dorothy L Sayers stated &#39;It is the one detective story of the present century which I am certain will go down to posterity as a classic. It is a masterpiece&#39;.Trent is unique for his day (early twentieth century) because he is a fallible and very human detective. Narrator Christopher Kay portrays Trent and his supporting characters as appropriate for their time but still realistic and believable for current listeners. Especially enjoyable is Miss Yates, whose nosy observations on her train and ship journeys set the murder investigation, which casts suspicion on Trent himself, in motion. Kay particularly excels as he utters phrases like "his prematurely bald cranium." An excellent choice for nostalgia buffs and those who prefer their mysteries very deliberately unraveled.

It was the largest covert action of the Cold War, and it was Devine who put the brand-new Stinger missile into the hands of the mujahideen during their war with the Soviets, paving the way to a decisive victory against the Russians. He also pushed the CIA's effort to run down the narcotics trafficker Pablo Escobar in Colombia. He tried to warn the director of central intelligence, George Tenet, that there was a bullet coming from Iraq with his name on it. He was in Chile when Allende fell, and he had too much to do with Iran-Contra for his own taste, though he tried to stop it. And he tangled with Rick Ames, the KGB spy inside the CIA, and hunted Robert Hanssen, the mole in the FBI.<br> <i>Good Hunting: An American Spymaster's Story </i>is the spellbinding memoir of Devine's time in the Central Intelligence Agency, where he served for more than thirty years, rising to become the acting deputy director of operations, responsible for all of the CIA's spying operations. This is a story of intrigue and high-stakes maneuvering, all the more gripping when the fate of our geopolitical order hangs in the balance. But this book also sounds a warning to our nation's decision makers: covert operations, not costly and devastating full-scale interventions, are the best safeguard of America's interests worldwide.<br> Part memoir, part historical redress, <i>Good Hunting</i> debunks outright some of the myths surrounding the Agency and cautions against its misuses. Beneath the exotic allure&#x2015;living abroad with his wife and six children, running operations in seven countries, and serving successive presidents from Nixon to Clinton&#x2015;this is a realist, gimlet-eyed account of the Agency. Now, as Devine sees it, the CIA is trapped within a larger bureaucracy, losing swaths of turf to the military, and, most ominous of all, is becoming overly weighted toward paramilitary operations after a decade of war. Its capacity to do what it does best&#x2015;spying and covert action&#x2015;has been seriously degraded.<br><i> Good Hunting </i>sheds light on some of the CIA's deepest secrets and spans an illustrious tenure&#x2015;and never before has an acting deputy director of operations come forth with such an account. With the historical acumen of Steve Coll's <i>Ghost Wars </i>and gripping scenarios that evoke the novels of John le Carr� even as they hew closely to the facts on the ground, Devine offers a master class in spycraft.</p></p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, June 2014:</strong> Meet Jack Devine. Something of a real-life George Smiley, he is a 30-year veteran of the CIA who, among a lot of things, ran Charlie Wilson's war against the Soviets in Afghanistan, knew a thing or two about the Iran-Contra affair long before the rest of us did (including the president?), and tangled with some of the agency's most notorious double-agents. In <em>Good Hunting: An American Spymaster&#x2019;s Story</em>, Devine has written a fascinating memoir of his time overseeing the agency&#x2019;s spying operations, while also critiquing its policies and direction--arguing that covert ops (i.e. actual undercover operatives on the ground) is the best, most effective use of the CIA&#x2019;s talents, rather than its increasingly paramilitaristic role during a decade of war. Devine has managed an unlikely accomplishment: enhancing the aura of the agency while stripping away some of its myths, in the process producing a clear-eyed and forthright account from an intelligence insider. <em>--Jon Foro</em></p>Jack Devine is a thirty-two-year veteran of the Central Intelligence Agency who served at the pinnacle of his career as the CIA's top spymaster&#x2015;head of the CIA's operations outside the United States, in which capacity he had supervisory authority over thousands of CIA employees involved in sensitive missions throughout the world. He is also a founding partner and the president of The Arkin Group, an international risk consulting and intelligence firm.

Surrounded by the terraced hills of the Yangtze River valley, Fuling has long been a place of continuity, far from the bustling political centers of Beijing and Shanghai. But now Fuling is heading down a new path, and gradually, along with scores of other towns in this vast and ever-evolving country, it is becoming a place of change and vitality, tension and reform, disruption and growth. As the people of Fuling hold on to the China they know, they are also opening up and struggling to adapt to a world in which their fate is uncertain.</p><p>Fuling's position at the crossroads came into remarkably sharp focus when Peter Hessler arrived as a Peace Corps volunteer in 1996, marking the first time in more than half a century that the city had an American resident. He found himself teaching English and American literature at the local college, discovering how Shakespeare and other classics look when seen through the eyes of students who have been raised in the Sichuan countryside and educated in Communist Party doctrine. His students, though, are the ones who taught him about the ways of Fuling -- and about the complex process of understanding that takes place when one is immersed in a radically different society.</p><p>As he learns the language and comes to know the people, Hessler begins to see that it is indeed a unique moment for Fuling. In its past is Communist China's troubled history -- the struggles of land reform, the decades of misguided economic policies, and the unthinkable damage of the Cultural Revolution -- and in the future is the Three Gorges Dam, which upon completion will partly flood the city and force the resettlement of more than a million people. Making his way in the city and traveling by boat and train throughout Sichuan province and beyond, Hessler offers vivid descriptions of the people he meets, from priests to prostitutes and peasants to professors, and gives voice to their views. This is both an intimate personal story of his life in Fuling and a colorful, beautifully written account of the surrounding landscape and its history. Imaginative, poignant, funny, and utterly compelling, River Town is an unforgettable portrait of a city that, much like China itself, is seeking to understand both what it was and what it someday will be.</p></p><p>In 1996, 26-year-old Peter Hessler arrived in Fuling, a town on China's Yangtze River, to begin a two-year Peace Corps stint as a teacher at the local college. Along with fellow teacher Adam Meier, the two are the first foreigners to be in this part of the Sichuan province for 50 years. Expecting a calm couple of years, Hessler at first does not realize the social, cultural, and personal implications of being thrust into a such radically different society. In <i>River Town: Two Years on the Yangtze</i>, Hessler tells of his experience with the citizens of Fuling, the political and historical climate, and the feel of the city itself.<p> "Few passengers disembark at Fuling ... and so Fuling appears like a break in a dream--the quiet river, the cabins full of travelers drifting off to sleep, the lights of the city rising from the blackness of the Yangtze," says Hessler. A poor city by Chinese standards, the students at the college are mainly from small villages and are considered very lucky to be continuing their education. As an English teacher, Hessler is delighted with his students' fresh reactions to classic literature. One student says of Hamlet, "I don't admire him and I dislike him. I think he is too sensitive and conservative and selfish." Hessler marvels, </p><blockquote>You couldn't have said something like that at Oxford. You couldn't simply say: I don't like Hamlet because I think he's a lousy person. Everything had to be more clever than that ... you had to dismantle it ... not just the play itself but everything that had ever been written about it.</blockquote> Over the course of two years, Hessler and Meier learn more they ever guessed about the lives, dreams, and expectations of the Fuling people.<p> Hessler's writing is lovely. His observations are evocative, insightful, and often poignant--and just as often, funny. It's a pleasure to read of his (mis)adventures. Hessler returned to the U.S. with a new perspective on modern China and its people.

Born in South Dakota and brought up in Bisbee, Arizona, Jance lives with her husband in Seattle, Washington, and Tucson, Arizona.</p>Once she clears the clouds obscuring issues of motive in the opening chapters, Jance ( Hour of the Hunter) proceeds with a gripping expose of cop murder and cover-up. Seattle police officer Ben Weston and his family--with the exception of the youngest son-- are brutally slaughtered at a critical point in Weston's undercover probe of youth gang activity. Several suspicious student loans are traced to Weston and members of the gangs he was investigating. In his 10th appearance, narrator and fellow cop J. P. "Beau" Beaumont vows to avenge his friend's death, meanwhile protecting the five-year-old survivor (and sole witness) and slowly realizing that the murder has little to do with student loans; he discovers dirty politics and graft reaching far into the department. Jance demands a lot from her readers: the likeliest suspects are completely hidden for a third of the tale, the loan angle makes little sense and the unconvincingly macho Beau never quite gels. Yet the shocks delivered as the villains are gradually unveiled and as Beaumont and pals try to keep the little boy alive resonate deeply.

Conceived by writer Chris Claremont and penciller John Byrne (credited as co-plotters, and aided immeasurably by inker Terry Austin), the story begins in <i>The Uncanny X-Men</i> #129 when Professor X sends his team in search of two new mutants detected by Cerebro. The figures in question turn out to be Kitty Pride, who would eventually join the team as Sprite, and the flashy disco singer Dazzler, who would go on to star in her own book. Little do the X-Men know that they're walking into a trap set by the Hellfire Club, a group of supervillains that seem perfectly matched to counter our merry mutants. The insidious part of the plot, however, is how a mysterious man named Jason Wyngarde seems to have been Jean Grey's lover in another time, another era, and how that might give him control over her now. Jean Grey was, like Cyclops, an original member of the X-Men, and had the power of telepathy (a gentle power, like that of the Invisible Girl of the same era). When she was reborn as Phoenix in issue #108, however, she became power incarnate. Can it be controlled, or must the X-Men make a choice between the woman they love and the fate of the universe? It's all here in this nine-issue volume, plus Wolverine alone, Emma Frost, the return of original members Angel and Beast, and a showdown with Lilandra's Imperial Guard in one of comics' great milestone issues, <i>X-Men</i> #137.

This brick tavern built in 1719 is still open for business and now sits among the skyscrapers of lower Manhattan. An editor recently treated me to a very fine lunch there. As I ate pot roast, mashed potatoes, then apple pie, I could just imagine Washington with his officers doing the same that cold December day of 1783.We join Abigail Stewart half a year after <i>The Winter of Red Snow</i> ended, in January of 1779.

In his version of <i>Dante's Divine Comedy</i>, Chwast's first graphic novel, Dante and his guide Virgil don fedoras and wander through noir-ish realms of Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise, finding both the wicked and the wondrous on their way. <p>Dante Alighieri wrote his epic poem <i>The Divine Comedy</i> from 1308 to 1321 while in exile from his native Florence. In the work's three parts (Inferno, Purgatory, and Paradise), Dante chronicles his travels through the afterlife, cataloging a multitude of sinners and saints&#x2014;many of them real people to whom Dante tellingly assigned either horrible punishment or indescribable pleasure&#x2014;and eventually meeting both God and Lucifer face-to-face.</p> <p>In his adaptation of this skewering satire, Chwast creates a visual fantasia that fascinates on every page: From the multifarious torments of the Inferno to the host of delights in Paradise, his inventive illustrations capture the delirious complexity of this classic of the Western canon.</p> <p> <strong>A Look Inside <i>Dante's Divine Comedy: A Graphic Adaptation</i></strong><br><b>(Click on Images to Enlarge)</b> <br> </p> <p></p><p></p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Second circle of Hell </td> <td> Sins of the flesh </td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td><td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> The three furies</td> <td> Sixth circle of Hell</td> </tr> </tbody></table><b>Seymour Chwast</b> was born in New York City and is a graduate of The Cooper Union, where he studied illustration and graphic design.

Stuck in the dirt floor is a huge diamond! Could a ring of jewel thieves be hiding out in Sleepyside?</p><p><b>Julie Campbell</b>&nbsp;(1908-1999) was from Flushing, New York, and shares the same birthday as her character, Mart Belden.&nbsp; As the daughter of an Army Officer, she travelled widely during her childhood. When she was eight years old, she won her first short story contest while living in Hawaii. In 1933, Campbell married Charles Tatham Jr., and they worked together on many magazine stories and articles.&nbsp; Campbell lived in a remodeled farmhouse in the Hudson River Valley with her husband and two sons when she began writing the Trixie Belden series. The series was set in fictional&nbsp;&#x201c;Sleepyside,&#x201d; but was based on the town Campbell was living in at the time in the Hudson River Valley near Ossining. Her home, &#x201c;Wolf Hollow,&#x201d; was the model for Crabapple Farm, and Campbell actually lived on Glendale Road. Julie Campbell passed away in 1999 at the age of 91.&nbsp; Even at 91 she was still spirited and determined, just like Trixie.The little cottage, which had been the gatehouse of the manor in the days of carriages and sleighs, was so covered with wisteria vines they could hardly see it. But Bobby&#x2019;s sharp blue eyes caught a glimpse of the door, and before Trixie could stop him, he raced down to yank it open.<br>&#x201c;Wait, Bobby,&#x201d; she yelled, &#x201c;don&#x2019;t go in until we&#x2013;&#x201d;<br>But he had already darted over the threshold. And then he screamed. Trixie, her heart in her mouth, dashed across the remaining stretch of lawn. What could have happened? What on earth could have been inside the old abandoned cottage to make Bobby scream?<br>Then she saw to her relief that he had merely tripped on the rotting door sill and lay sprawling in the semidarkness of the interior.<br>&#x201c;Honestly,&#x201d; Trixie moaned to Honey, &#x201c;if there&#x2019;s anything in the whole of Westchester County to trip over, Bobby trips over it.&#x201d;<br>Together, they helped the little boy to his feet and carried him out to the bright light. Blood was trickling from his right knee. Trixie was used to Bobby&#x2019;s accidents, but she knew that the sight of blood sometimes made Honey feel faint.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s nothing,&#x201d; she said quickly as she tied her clean handkerchief around the cut. &#x201c;Bobby is always covered with bandages, anyway. He must have fallen on a pebble in the dirt floor.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I wanna go home,&#x201d; Bobby was wailing.<br>&#x201c;Of course you do,&#x201d; Honey cried sympathetically. &#x201c;But let&#x2019;s ask Regan to look at your knee, first. He knows all about first aid, you know.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I want Regan,&#x201d; Bobby said promptly through his tears. &#x201c;I <i>love</i> Regan. He&#x2019;ll give me a ride on Lady.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; Trixie said. &#x201c;<i>If</i> you don&#x2019;t cry when he puts iodine on your cut. Do you want to ride pickaback on my shoulders, or can you walk?&#x201d;<br>Bobby tossed his silky curls. &#x201c;I never yell when people put iodine on me.&#x201d; He started off up the grassy slope toward the stable, first hopping, then limping, and finally, when he caught sight of Regan, he broke into a run.<br>The tall, broad-shouldered groom scooped the boy into his arms and gently removed Trixie&#x2019;s improvised bandage.<br>&#x201c;First aid me, Regan,&#x201d; Bobby ordered. &#x201c;First aid me. Take me up to your room on top of the g&#x2019;rage and first aid me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That I will,&#x201d; Regan said, grinning. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t cut yourself on a rusty nail, did you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know what he fell on,&#x201d; Trixie replied and turned to Honey. &#x201c;I guess we&#x2019;d better go back and look inside the cottage with flashlights to make sure. If it was a rusty nail that cut him, Bobby should have a booster tetanus shot. Puncture wounds, you know.&#x201d;<br>Honey nodded. &#x201c;There&#x2019;re a couple of flashlights in the tack room. All right if we borrow them, Regan?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Natch,&#x201d; the pleasant-faced groom said as he strode toward the garage with Bobby. &#x201c;The kid probably cut himself on a harmless pebble, but you girls had better make sure. Meanwhile, I&#x2019;ll wash the knee and paint it with iodine.&#x201d;<br>Five minutes later the girls stood at the entrance to the old cottage. &#x201c;He must have fallen right about here,&#x201d; Trixie said, pointing with the beam of her flashlight. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s got short legs, so when he tripped on the sill&#x2013;&#x201d; She stopped. Something glittered in the beam of her torch. &#x201c;A piece of glass,&#x201d; she said moving cautiously inside.<br>Honey followed her, and then they saw that the glittering object was imbedded in the dirt floor. Trixie pried it loose with a twig.<br>&#x201c;Oh, golly,&#x201d; she gasped. &#x201c;It looks just like the stone in the ring Jim gave me. You remember, Honey, his great-aunt&#x2019;s solitaire which we found up at the mansion before it burned. Dad put it in our safety deposit box at the bank until I&#x2019;m older. But this couldn&#x2019;t be a diamond.&#x201d;<br>She led the way outside and handed the stone to Honey. Honey examined it carefully. The facets glittered brilliantly in the bright sunlight. After a moment, Honey said in an awed tone of voice, &#x201c;But it is a diamond, Trixie! I&#x2019;m sure! How on earth did it get inside this old, tumbledown cottage?&#x201d;</p><h2>My Antonia, Literary Touchstone Edition</h2><p>This Prestwick House Literary Touchstone Classic&#x2122; includes a glossary and reader&#x2019;s notes to help the modern reader contend with Cather&#x2019;s allusions and vocabulary. <p>My �ntonia, Willa Cather&#x2019;s vivid portrayal of immigrant life on the American prairie during the nineteenth century, has been a favorite since it first appeared in 1918. The harsh&#x2014;yet forgiving&#x2014;land, the growth and maturity of Jim Burden, the narrator, the intriguing characters, and the force of �ntonia&#x2019;s strength all combine to make this novel exceptional. </p><p>Cather&#x2019;s style perfectly depicts the sparseness of the prairie and the desolation of the immigrants&#x2019; existence in winter and comes alive when the glory and beauty of spring emerge. </p><p>Whether you see it as a love story, an indelible portrait of a wise, enduring female character, or a coming-of-age novel, My �ntonia is deserving of its respected place in American literature.</p></p><p>It seems almost sacrilege to infringe upon a book as soulful and rich as Willa Cather's <i>My �ntonia</i> by offering comment. First published in 1918, and set in Nebraska in the late 19th century, this tale of the spirited daughter of a Bohemian immigrant family planning to farm on the untamed land ("not a country at all but the material out of which countries are made") comes to us through the romantic eyes of Jim Burden. He is, at the time of their meeting, newly orphaned and arriving at his grandparents' neighboring farm on the same night her family strikes out to make good in their new country. Jim chooses the opening words of his recollections deliberately: "I first heard of �ntonia on what seemed to be an interminable journey across the great midland plain of North America," and it seems almost certain that readers of Cather's masterpiece will just as easily pinpoint the first time they heard of �ntonia and her world. It seems equally certain that they, too, will remember that moment as one of great light in an otherwise unremarkable trip through the world.<p> �ntonia, who, even as a grown woman somewhat downtrodden by circumstance and hard work, "had not lost the fire of life," lies at the center of almost every human condition that Cather's novel effortlessly untangles. She represents immigrant struggles with a foreign land and tongue, the restraints on women of the time (with which Cather was very much concerned), the more general desires for love, family, and companionship, and the great capacity for forbearance that marked the earliest settlers on the frontier.</p><p> As if all this humanity weren't enough, Cather paints her descriptions of the vastness of nature--the high, red grass, the road that "ran about like a wild thing," the endless wind on the plains--with strokes so vivid as to make us feel in our bones that we've just come in from a walk on that very terrain ourselves. As the story progresses, Jim goes off to the University in Lincoln to study Latin (later moving on to Harvard and eventually staying put on the East Coast in another neat encompassing of a stage in America's development) and learns Virgil's phrase "<i>Optima dies ... prima fugit</i>" that Cather uses as the novel's epigraph. "The best days are the first to flee"--this could be said equally of childhood and the earliest hours of this country in which the open land, much like <i>My �ntonia</i>, was nothing short of a rhapsody in prairie sky blue. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

Her many awards include the Kate Greenaway Medal and the prestigious Eleanor Farjeon Award for her services to children's literature.Hughes offers readers her usual clear-eyed view of childhood in this 64-page collection of stories. It's a leisurely visit with siblings Alfie and baby Annie Rose; he teaches her to feed herself, and she rewards him cruelly: the very first name she learns to say is that of his friend Bernard. The children know all the people up and down their street, and theirs is a friendly world--when a neighbor, Mrs. McNally, gives Alfie a hat, he in turn offers it to the milkman on a rainy day. Light, unrhymed poems punctuate the stories about this school-age boy and his toddler sister. Fans of the other Alfie books and those meeting the family for the first time will be pleased by the real-life situations, jauntily depicted in Hughes's fresh-faced watercolors.

Advances in hydrodynamics, materials, and computer technology have created lighter, stronger, faster, and more comfortable sailboats than ever before. But the language of this transformation can be truly intimidating, as every sailing magazine reader soon learns. When designers and builders of sailing yachts struggle to keep up, what hope is there for sailors? Plenty, thanks to this new bible of sailboat design, comprehensible to amateurs, comprehensive for professionals. It follows the design of a 40-foot cruising sailboat from the first sketch to the final weight, strength, and sail area calculations, with tables, charts, and diagrams to let the reader adapt the process to any other design.</p><p><p><i>Principles of Yacht Design</i> was the first book for mnay years to examine every aspect of the process of yacht design and was welcomed with open arms by owners of boats small and large, practising designers, naval architecture students and the boatbuilding industry as a whole. Now revised and expanded for its second edition to cover power boat design in more detail, it makes an even more valuable contribution to our understanding of the process of yacht design. </p><p>The authors have used a newly designed 40 foot performance cruiser to demonstrate the practical application of yacht design theory. Beginning with the yacht's specificaitons, the authors explain the geometry of the hull by means of lines plans and introduce CAD techniques. Hydrostatics and stability in calm water as well as waves are described in detail, as is the design of the hull, keel and rudder. Next the aerodynamics of the sails and the influence this has on the shape of the sail plan is examined. Methods are introduced for finding the balance of the yacht, and there is a short chapter on selecting the correct propeller and the engine. The special hydrodynamics of high-speed power boats is also addressed for the first time in this edition. </p><p>Structural aspects of the design are treated comprehensively for both sail and power boats. Loads acting on the hull and rig are identified and methods for computing them introduced. There is also a discussion of different fibre reinforced plastics, including sandwich laminates. Finally, practical matters such as the layout of the cockpit, deck and cabin are discussed, and a complete weight calculation is provided for the 40-footer. </p><p>The book is richly illustrated with explanatory diagrams, and although the subject is complicated, the authors treat it in a remarkably clear and concise manner, making it easily understandable for both professionals and amateurs interested in the principles of yacht design. </p><p>"This book is deeply fascinating . . . a must."--<i>Classic Boat</i> </p><p>"Here at last is a book that replaces <i>Skene's Elements of Yacht Design</i> as the yacht designer's bible."--<i>Yachting Monthly</i> </p><p>"A copy belongs in the collection of any aspiring designer."--<i>Soundings</i> </p><p>"Essential in understanding the new era in Yacht design."--<i>WoodenBoat</i> </p><p>"Bound to become a classic."--<i>Cruising World</i> </p><p>"A definitive work on yacht design."--<i>Cruising</i> </p><p>"A new bible on yacht design."--<i>SA Yachting</i> </p><p>"A sound and up to date manual of yacht design . . . a classic in its field."--<i>Practical Boat Owner</i></p><p><b>Lars Larsson</b>, a naval architect, is Professor of Hydrodynamics at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden.

Made of rice paper, at once ingenious and deadly, they sailed thousands of miles across the Pacific...and once they started landing, the U.S. scrambled teams to find and defuse them, and then keep them secret from an already anxious public. Eighteen-year-old Louis Belk was one of those men. Dispatched to the Alaskan frontier, young Sergeant Belk was better trained in bomb disposal than in keeping secrets. And the mysteries surrounding his mission only increased when he met his superior officer&#x2014;a brutal veteran OSS spy hunter who knew all too well what the balloons could do&#x2014;and Lily, a Yup&#x2019;ik Eskimo woman who claimed she could see the future.<br><br>Louis&#x2019;s superior ushers him into a world of dark secrets; Lily introduces Louis to an equally disorienting world of spirits&#x2014;and desire. But the world that finally tests them all is Alaska, whose vastness cloaks mysteries that only become more frightening as they unravel. Chasing after the ghostly floating weapons, Louis embarks upon an adventure that will lead him deep into the tundra. There, on the edge of the endless wilderness, he will make a discovery and a choice that will change the course of his life. <br><br>At once a heart-quickening mystery and a unique love story, <i>The Cloud Atlas</i> is also a haunting, lyrical rendering of a little-known chapter in history. Brilliantly imagined, beautifully told, this is storytelling at its very best.</p><p>In his gorgeous debut novel, <i>The Cloud Atlas</i>, Liam Callanan merges fact and fantasy in a dual narrative set in Alaska amidst the waning days of World War II. In a hospice care facility Louis Belk is an aged priest providing religious comfort and confession to a dying friend, a Yup'ik shaman named Ronnie. But, as Ronnie reaches the final stages of life, Belk begins a confession of his own. <p> The narrative turns back to young Belk's career as a bomb disposal specialist during the war. When Belk witnesses a bizarre balloon explosive kill several soldiers at Fort Cronkhite outside of San Francisco, he is summarily shipped to Alaska to join a top secret military unit dedicated to uncovering the mystery of what turn out to be Japanese balloon bombs (Callanan based this story on an actual Japanese program that was largely covered up by the US government during the war). Belk's commanding officer, Captain Gurley--a cross between Conrad's Colonel Kurz and Melville's Ahab--is a disgraced former OSS man with a Princeton pedigree and an artificial leg. The leg is a permanent reminder of his failure to defuse his first balloon bomb, and it fuels an obsession to discover and collect all such bombs in the future. In possession of a captured leather-bound atlas filled with maps and neat Japanese script, Gurley is also convinced that the Japanese are about to launch far more deadly cargo on the balloons, perhaps spies or plague virus. Meanwhile, Belk and Gurley become embroiled in an explosive love triangle with the local fortune teller, Lily, a woman with an uncanny ability to read people's lives but unable to understand her own destructive passions or escape her demons. </p><p> In unfolding this complicated story, Callan manages to keep the development of Belk, Lily, and Gurney in an almost perfect balance with the telling of a well-paced and compelling war-time narrative. Callanan enriches the novel with details of 1940s bomb disposal procedures and provides a thorough anatomy of Japanese balloon bombs. He also establishes Alaska--a place seemingly caught between American and Yup'ik culture--as a space for American magical realism, where spirit animals and Catholic mysticism can cohabitate. As a first effort, <i>The Cloud Atlas</i> is all silver lining. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>Liam Callanan teaches creative writing at Georgetown University and frequently appears on NPR&#x2019;s Morning Edition and in <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Washington Post</i>, and a number of other publications.

Uprooted from their working- and middle-class neighborhoods, they joined every branch of the military and saw action on all fronts. Deborah Dash Moore offers an unprecedented view of the struggles these GI Jews faced, having to battle not only the enemy but also the prejudices of their fellow soldiers. </p><p> Through memoirs, oral histories, and letters, Moore charts the lives of fifteen young Jewish men as they faced military service and tried to make sense of its demands. From confronting pork chops to enduring front-line combat, from the temporary solace of Jewish worship to harrowing encounters with death camp survivors, we come to understand how these soldiers wrestled with what it meant to be an American and a Jew. </p><p> Moore shows how military service in World War II transformed this generation of Jews, reshaping Jewish life in America and abroad. These men challenged perceptions of Jews as simply victims of the war, and encouraged Jews throughout the diaspora to fight for what was right. At the same time, service strengthened Jews' identification with American democratic ideals, even as it confirmed the importance of their Jewish identity. <i>GI Jews</i> is a powerful, intimate portrayal of the costs of a conflict that was at once physical, emotional, and spiritual, as well as its profound consequences for these hitherto overlooked members of the "greatest generation." </p></p><p>Deborah Dash Moore is the Frederick G.L. Huetwell Professor of History at University of Michigan.Rich in detail and insight, this deeply affecting book pays tribute to both the unsung heroism of the American Jewish servicemen of World War II and to the historian's craft. A must read for anyone whose grandfather, father, brother, uncle and cousins proudly lay claim to being a 'GI Jew.'<br> --Jenna Weissman Joselit, author of <i>The Wonders of America: Reinventing Jewish Culture, 1880-1950</i><br><br>Imagine yourself a young man just become an American soldier in World War II, burdened by the same anxieties and fears of those around you but compelled to overcome by your bearing virulent stereotypes of those like you - - as weaklings, malingerers, cowards. How Jewish GIs fought prejudice, won respect and in the process strengthened their identities as Americans and as Jews is the fascinating and exceptionally well-told story Deborah Dash Moore offers us in <i>GI Jews</i>.<br> --Gerald Linderman, author of <i>The World within War: America's Combat Experience in World War II</i><br><br>Written with a deft eye for telling detail, this engaging book sharpens our understanding of how service in World War Two deepened and transformed the identities of Jewish soldiers. By interweaving rich individual stories to portray how they joined, served, worshipped, fought, and returned, <i>GI Jews</i> paints a pointillist picture of the large-scale experience of a generation that entered America on fresh terms. In so doing, it continues Deborah Dash Moore's important and resonant quest to understand how the children of immigrants could become more American but not less Jewish.<br> --Ira Katznelson, <i>Desolation and Enlightenment: Political Knowledge After Total War, Totalitarianism, and the Holocaust</i><br><br><i>GI Jews</i> recounts the story of American Jews in World War II and explains why that story matters. Based on a wealth of interviews and contemporary letters, this gracefully-written work stands as a monument to American Jewry's own 'greatest generation.'<br> --Jonathan D. Sarna, author of <i>American Judaism: A History</i><br><br>World War II profoundly changed the face of American society. So too did it dramatically change the lives of the Jewish GIs who served in the American military. Deborah Dash Moore's powerful portrayal of their experience illuminates that change. It is a fascinating and important story and Moore tells it in a compelling fashion.<br> --Deborah E. Lipstadt, author of <i>Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory</i><br><br>Serving in WWII made American Jewish soldiers feel both more Jewish and more American, writes historian Moore in this insightful study. Relying mainly on memoirs and oral interviews of 15 veterans, Moore shows how many of them had taken their Jewish identity for granted in the Jewish enclaves where they grew up...The stories these soldiers tell are compelling, and Moore does an admirable job of knowing when to interpret and when to let the experiences speak for themselves. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2004-07-19)<br><br>In this impressively written book, Moore takes as her focus a number of Jewish individuals--among them rabbis, college graduates, manual laborers, and her own father--and demonstrates how military service in World War II transformed their worldviews. The transformation often began during military training, where many Jews broke out of their insular ethnic world and discovered the diversity of America. During their military service, they confronted anti-Semitism, racism, the fear of combat, the loneliness of being a minority, and the challenge of living a Jewish life in a military that regarded ham products as one of the four basic food groups. Moore's greatest strength is her ability to integrate the story of the individual into the wider issues facing America. In the process, she helps lay to rest the notion that there was a single Jewish response to the wartime experience.<br> --Frederic Krome (<i>Library Journal</i> 2004-08-01)<br><br>Deborah Dash Moore tells [the] unique story [of 15 Jewish GIs] with eloquence and restraint.<br> --Irma Kurtz (<i>Jewish Chronicle</i> 2005-02-11)<br><br>Moore has produced a lucid account of Jewish military service during World War II, telling her tale largely through the experiences of 15 Jewish soldiers, including her own father...Deborah Dash Moore ably conveys the subtleties and intricacies of why my father and others serving during World War II did not surrender or feel compelled to hide their Jewishness. Throughout her narrative, she points out that military service empowered these young men as Jews as well as Americans.<br> --Judy Bolton-Fasman (<i>Jerusalem Report</i> 2005-01-10)<br><br>The great surprise of the season in World War II books is Deborah Dash Moore's wonderful <i>GI Jews: How World War II Changed a Generation</i>...It is an enjoyable read. Moore, a Vassar professor, writes well and knows how to tell a story...She has an eye for interesting characters and for what makes them interesting...She keeps up a lively pace and intersperses evocative vignettes with insightful analysis of what these Jewish troops' experiences meant to them, their families, their communities and the nation as a whole...For postwar generations, her book reveals how the experience of the war changed the generation that fought it and why it helped launch the civil rights movement, the Great Society and America's rise to global predominance. <i>GI Jews</i> should not be missed by anyone with an interest in World War II or the history of the American people.<br> --Kenneth M.

She is appointed by the Archbishop as Advocatus Diaboli-the Devil's Advocate-to argue against the beatification of Roger Atworth, a friar in the Order of the Sack and the confessor of Dame Cecily of York, King Edward's mother. Atworth has died under mysterious circumstances, and there are rumors afloat of miraculous happenings surrounding his body. At the same time, an infestation of rats has begun to afflict Canterbury. Never in the history of the city has such an invasion occurred, and the topic is one everyone's lips.<br><br>Meanwhile, when Kathryn begins asking questions at the friary about Atworth's death, she discovers that the logical explanation is murder, not a miracle. His involvement with Cecily may have brought about his demise, and Kathryn suspects a link between his death and that of an English spy outside the friary. With the murderer still on the loose, what began as a search for the town's ills becomes instead Kathryn's pursuit of a killer.<br></p><p><b>C.L. Grace </b>is the pseudonym of P.C. Doherty, author of four previous mysteries featuring Kathryn Swinbrooke as well as several other mystery series. He holds a doctorate from Oxford and lives in Essex, England.<br>When rats threaten to infest Canterbury, physician and apothecary Kathryn Swinbrooke and her lover, Colum Murtagh, Master of the King's Horse, team up for a fourth time, in an intriguing tale of espionage and murder from British author Grace (The Merchant of Death, etc.). The aged Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Bourchier, seeks Kathryn's aid in overseeing a plan to rid the city of the rats that have mysteriously appeared just as Canterbury prepares for the multitudes coming to worship at the shrine of the martyred saint, Thomas ... Becket. Even more mysterious are the miracles attributed to the corpse of the recently deceased friar, Roger Atworth, confessor to King Edward IV's mother, Cecily of York, who fears the possible revelation of personal secrets. Using her keen investigative skills and knowledge of medieval forensics, Kathryn discovers the rats in Canterbury are not limited to the furry, four-legged variety. The author stretches credulity a bit when Kathryn figures out the significance of a passage from the prophet Zephaniah, left by a murdered messenger. It's too bad she didn't supply a good modern translation of the Middle English chapter heads from The Canterbury Tales, but she brings the period alive with authentic historical details and characters as diverse as Chaucer's pilgrims. Some fans may find the rats on the arresting stained-glass jacket design a little off-putting, but they can take comfort in knowing the story's focus is chiefly on the human rodents. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Soupy Leaves Home</h2><p>Set in 1932, this is the story of two misfits with no place to call home, who build a relationship during a train hopping journey from the cold heartbreak of their eastern homes toward the sunny promise of California.<br><br>Pearl "Soupy" Plankette ran away from her abusive father, but has nowhere to go until she stumbles upon a disguise that gives her the key to a new identity.

Rose George has done us a great service by taking something that we don't talk about nearly often enough and putting it right in our faces. Anyone heading overseas on a mission trip should read this book first. And anyone who wants to understand what it means to be poor.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Bill McKibben, author of Deep Economy</i></p><p>&#x201c;Rose George's subject--the global politics of defecation--is both superbly indelicate and morally imperative. With the basic health and dignity of several billion poor people at stake, we need to take shit seriously in the most literal sense. Human solidarity, as she so passionately demonstrates, begins with the squatting multitudes.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Mike Davis, author of Planet of Slums</i></p><p>&#x201c;Which is worse? Living in a toilet or living without one? George bravely--and sometimes literally--submerges herself in the tragedy and occasional comedy of global sanitation.

The most unforgettable book to pass through the publishing pipeline in years.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Mary Roach, author of Stiff</i></p><p>&#x201c;This engaging, highly readable book puts sanitation in its proper place--as a central challenge in human development. Rose George has tackled this critical topic with insight, wit, and a storyteller's flair.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Louis Boorstin, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</i></p><p>&#x201c;Excellent... Definitely recommended.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Tyler Cowen, author of Discover Your Inner Economist</i></p><p>&#x201c;Rose George has trolled the gutters of the world for the predictable low-matter and come up with something weirdly spiritual. Worship the porcelain god, revere its ubiquity and protest its absence: George reveals that the act of private and sanitary defecation is the key to health, the wealth of nations, and even civilization itself.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Lisa Margonelli, author of Oil on the Brain</i></p><p>&#x201c;Highly recommended... One of the best nonfiction books I've read in years.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Henry Gee, senior editor of Nature</i></p><p>&#x201c;This fascinating, wise, and scrupulously drawn portrait of the world and its waste will last long as a seriously important book. Like a literary treatment farm, it manages to turn the completely unpalatable into something utterly irresistible. Rose George, a brave, compassionate, and ceaselessly impeccable reporter--and, when needed, a very funny one too--has performed for us all who care a very great service. A big necessity, indeed.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Simon Winchester, author of The Man Who Loved China</i></p><p>&#x201c;Throughout her exploration of the dark and pungent world of human waste and its disposal, George remains curious, sceptical, open-minded and remarkably good-humoured... She has written a tactful, outspoken, amusing, shocking, highly informative and useful book. It may even--if you read it carefully--change your life.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Sunday Telegraph (UK)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Will entertain and edify...

Peter Abelard was arguably the greatest poet, philosopher, and religious teacher in all of twelfth-century Europe. In an age when women were rarely educated, Heloise was his most gifted young student. As master of the cathedral school at Notre Dame in Paris, Abelard was expected to be celibate; his career would be destroyed by marrying. In spite of this, Abelard and Heloise's private tutoring sessions inevitably turned to passionate romance, and their moments apart were spent writing love letters.</p><p>When Heloise became pregnant, her possessive guardian and uncle, Fulbert, angrily insisted that they marry. The ceremony was held in secret, but the rumor spread through Paris. Enemies confronted Heloise, who publicly denied the marriage in order to protect Abelard's career. Fearing for her safety, Abelard slipped Heloise out of the city and sent her to a convent. Robbed of his niece and his family's honor, Fulbert took revenge by having Abelard brutally castrated. Abelard retreated to a monastery, and the famous lovers now lived separate lives behind cloistered walls -- but their love, and their letters, continued.</p><p>For a long time, the only letters known to have survived dated from the later period of their separation. Then, astoundingly, a few years ago a young scholar identified 113 new letters between the pair. Lost for almost nine hundred years, these fresh missives provide an intriguing snapshot of the couple's clandestine passion that is erotic, poignant, and at times even funny.</p><p>James Burge is the first biographer to combine these astonishing new discoveries with the latest scholarship, resulting in a more complete biography; one that paints a fuller picture of Heloise as a woman who tested the cultural constraints of her time. Burge also addresses Abelard's theological disputes with other teachers, including Bernard of Clairvaux, which led to Abelard's eventual trial for heresy. But <em>Heloise &amp; Abelard</em> is much more than a biography. It opens a window onto the enormous and exciting changes that took place in medieval Europe, even as it presents us with the richest telling yet of one of history's greatest love stories.</p></p><p><p>James Burge is a producer and director of documentaries for the BBC and the Discovery Channel. His fascination with the Middle Ages led him to make <em>Strange Landscape</em>, the BBC series about medieval culture, and to create a dramatization of the writings of the eccentric thirteenth-century English friar, Roger Bacon.</p>The romance of H�lo�se and Abelard remains one of the greatest love stories of all time&#x2014;one of forbidden love; the eventual lifelong separation of the lovers, cloistered in a monastery and convent; and the vengeful castration of Abelard by H�lo�se's uncle. More tantalizingly, we know of the affair only from eight surviving letters between the couple. But British <i>Sunday Independent </i>columnist Burge draws on 113 recently translated letters that have been attributed to the lovers. Based on all of these letters, Burge analyzes the feelings and states of mind of the correspondents, and he can be a bit pedantic at times. But who can fail to be moved by the passion expressed in the letters? "Even during the celebration of the Mass," H�lo�se famously wrote, "when our prayers should be purest, lewd visions of the pleasures we shared take... a hold on my unhappy soul...." Burge relates Abelard's theological struggles with the medieval Church, especially with the powerful Cistercian leader Bernard of Clairvaux. Unlike in previous biographies, H�lo�se emerges as a leader, too, in her role as abbess of the Paraclete, which she developed into a substantial institution. A complex woman, she sought a unified sense of self that would incorporate both her sexuality and her religious faith. Readers new to this medieval drama will be drawn to this vivid account.

In its pages you will find effective ways to solve a host of complications and potentially serious situations which can and often do arise during pregnancy, labor, and delivery, as well as post-partum problems and the critical first weeks and months of neonatal life. Review &#34;Dr. Perko has written a thoroughly informative and easily usable text covering almost all conceivable clinical topics concerning pregnancy, labor, the post-partum period, ailments of the newborn child, and breast and nursing problems. Remedy descriptions are clear, succinct, and highly practical. The organization of the book is impeccable. Information can be easily and quickly accessed, a quality many birthing attendants will find of immense value when emergencies arise. The ample differential materia medica is organized according to remedies frequency of utility. The Table of Contents is expanded and a Quick Keynote Reference is provided for faster access to information. This book is the most thorough and usable working homeopath&#39;s reference to homeopathic obstetrics that I have seen to date. I highly recommend it to all homeopaths who maintain an obstetrics practice, or who tend to pregnant women and nursing mothers.&#34; -- George Guess, M.D., D. Ht., Journal of The American Institute of Homeopathy, Autumn 1997 &#34;Finally a concise but comprehensive therapeutic handbook which is precisely what midwives and health care providers familiar with classical homeopathy need to help them differentiate between many choices of homeopathic medicines available to treat the many medical problems of pregnant women or their infants. This is the book midwives and those caring for pregnant women and their infants will take to the clinic, birthing room and home to help them choose the homeopathic medicine for their patients problems of pregnancy.&#34; Jacquelyn J Wilson, MD., D Ht, 1997</p><p>Sandra Perko has written what will no doubt prove to be the most comprehensive reference work on the subject of homeopathy and pregnancy for the English speaking homeopathic community. Midwives, physicians, nurses, and professional as well as lay homeopathic practitioners will find themselves reaching for this book time and time again as they assist pregnant women through any number of prenatal and neonatal difficulties. Those who teach homeopathy to midwives or who conduct prenatal classes will find this book to be the most complete reference work available to assist them in teaching every aspect of prenatal and neonatal care. Yet, this book is certainly not just for the professional. The pregnant woman herself, who knows the wonderful benefits of homeopathy, will be able to anticipate and solve, through the use of this book, many of the potential prenatal and neonatal problems in order to insure a happy and trouble-free pregnancy and delivery.In my twenty years of practice as a clinical nutritionists and homeopath I have had the privilege of working with many expectant mothers and their infants, as well as with a group of very dedicated midwives. I have seen first-hand they type of problems that they face in their day-to-day practice, as well as throughout the actual labor and delivery. I have learned a great deal from them, and I have a very deep respect for their profession, their knowledge, and compassion, and their profound commitment to their craft. My main goal in writing this book was to provide for the physician and midwife a practical reference which could be easily and quickly accessed, especially in emergency situations. Although it is written with the practice of midwifery in mind, all homeopathic practitioners, now matter what their primary practice focus, will find it useful in working with pregnant women under their care. Homeopathy is one of the fastest growing self-help therapies in home health care. Therefore, pregnant women who are acquainted with the use of homeopathy will find this book extremely valuable throughout their entire prenatal and post-natal experience.</p><h2>More Tales of Pirx the Pilot (English and Polish Edition)</h2><p>In a collection of four short stories, Pirx, a bumbling space patrol pilot, contends with some surprisingly human robots and survives an epidemic of mumps that hits the crew of a scrap-collecting spaceship</p><p>Commander Pirx, who drives space vehicles for a living in the galaxy of the future, here faces a new series of intriguing adventures in which robots demonstrate some alarmingly human characteristics.

The two longest stories are puzzles in which the mysteries of artificial intelligence are explored. Pirx wrestles every step of the way with his mixed feelings about robots, which make him increasingly suspicious and apprehensive.

Pitilessly brilliant'</b> Jonathan Coe. </p><p>In exploring the answers to the question: 'why did Britain vote leave?', Fintan O'Toole finds himself discovering how trivial journalistic lies became far from trivial national obsessions; how the pose of indifference to truth and historical fact has come to define the style of an entire political elite; how a country that once had colonies is redefining itself as an oppressed nation requiring liberation; the strange gastronomic and political significance of prawn-flavoured crisps, and their role in the rise of Boris Johnson; the dreams of revolutionary deregulation and privatisation that drive Arron Banks, Nigel Farrage and Jacob Rees-Mogg; and the silent rise of English nationalism, the force that dare not speak its name. </p><p>He also discusses the fatal attraction of heroic failure, once a self-deprecating cult in a hugely successful empire that could well afford the occasional disaster: the Charge of the Light Brigade, or Franklin lost in the Arctic. Now failure is no longer heroic &#x2013; it is just failure, and its terrible costs will be paid by the most vulnerable of Brexit's supporters, and by those who may suffer the consequences of a hard border in Ireland and the breakdown of a fragile peace. </p></p><p></p><h2>Uncle John&#39;s Legendary Lost Bathroom Reader (Uncle John&#39;s Bathroom Reader Series)</h2><p>Long ago, <i>Bathroom Reader</i> fans everywhere cried out in terror when Uncle John&#x2019;s legendary 5th, 6th, and 7th editions were taken out of print.

Hutson describes the rise of organized religion in America and its interaction with government from the arrival of Protestant and Catholic groups in New England and the middle Colonies in the early 17th century to the establishment of new religious groups in the early decades of the 19th century. By interpreting the Puritans&#39; arrival in New England in the context of European religious persecution, he lays the groundwork for his examination of the evolving relationship between church and state in America. The history of Rhode Island Baptists and Pennsylvania Quakers prefigured the principles of religious freedom and separation of church and state laid down in the founding documents of the US. Hutson describes the founding of the federal and state governments and the founders&#39; attitudes toward religion&#39;s role in government. Hutson&#39;s own expertise and the Library of Congress&#39;s rich documentation of this period give particular weight and interest to this period.</p><p>8 1/2 x 11 trim. 77 illus. (16 color).

With a few exceptions, they use ingredients that are readily available and found in most markets in most towns throughout the United States. All the recipes are easy to prepare, all completely doable for the novice and experienced cook alike.

Year One of the Russian Revolution is Serge&#x2019;s attempt to defend the early days of the revolution against those, like Stalin, who would claim its legacy as justification for the repression of dissent within Russia.</p><p>Victor Serge (1889-1947) is best known as a novelist &#x2013; with two of his works recently republished by the New York Review of Books &#x2013; and for his <i>Memoirs of a Revolutionary</i>. Originally a participant in the anarchist movement, Serge became a committed bolshevik upon arrival in Russia during 1919 and lent his considerable talents to the cause of spreading the revolution across Europe. An eloquent critic of tyranny no matter its form, Serge was a leading member of the Left Opposition in its struggle against Stalin, a cause which ultimately resulted in his exile from Russia.<br><br>Peter Sedgwick (1934&#x2013;1983) was a lifelong activist and a founding member of the New Left in Britain, and one of the first translators of Serge's work into English. In addition to his journalism and political writings, he is the author of a book, <i>Psycho-Politics</i>.&#x201c;[T]he re-issuing of this remarkable work, by a truly remarkable individual, is so timely, and welcome...For all its faults (and Peter Sedgwick, who translated this work, is unsparing in his criticisms of some of Serge&#x2019;s analyses), this work is a tribute to an outstanding, and unyielding revolutionary who told it as he saw it, was a fearless opponent of Stalin, and an intransigent revolutionary to his dying day. More importantly, it gives the reader an ability to comprehend the hard choices facing revolutionaries at a time when no one knew the outcome, when the very revolution itself was facing defeat...All of which makes this an heroic work.&#x201d;<br><strong>&#x2015;Richard Allday, <em>Counterfire</em></strong><br>&#x201c;He was an eyewitness of events of world historical importance, of great hope and even greater tragedy. His political recollections are very important, because they reflect so well the mood of this lost generation . . . His articles and books speak for themselves, and we would be poorer without them.&#x201d;<br><strong>&#x2015;<em>Partisan Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;I know of no other writer with whom Serge can be very usefully compared. The essence of the man and his books is to be found in his attitude to the truth. There have of course been many scrupulously honest writers. But for Serge the value of the truth extended far beyond the simple (or complex) telling of it.&#x201d;<br><strong> &#x2013;John Berger</strong><br><br>&#x201c;A witness to revolution and reaction in Europe between the wars, Serge searingly evoked the epochal hopes and shattering setbacks of a generation of leftists...Yet under the bleakest of conditions, Serge&#x2019;s optimism, his humane sympathies and generous spirit, never waned. A radical misfit, no faction, no sect could contain him; he inhabited a lonely no-man&#x2019;s-land all his own. These qualities are precisely what make him such an inspiring, even moving figure.&#x201d;<br><em><strong>&#x2015;Book Forum</strong></em><br><br>&#x201c;The novels, poems, memoirs and other writings of Victor Serge are among the finest works of literature inspired by the October Revolution that brought the working class to power in Russia in 1917. . . . His articles&#x2015;like the work of John Reed, his American friend&#x2015;let us follow revolutionary events as they unfold, as seen through the eyes of an exceptionally alert journalist.&#x201d;<br><strong>&#x2015;Scott McLemee</strong><br><br>"Victor Serge is one of the unsung heroes of a corrupt century."<br><strong>&#x2015;Adam Hochschild, author of <em>King Leopold's Ghost</em></strong><br><p>"This was Serge&#x2019;s first non-literary work, composed in the late 1920s and, as he put it, &#x201c;in detached fragments which could each be separately completed and sent abroad post-haste&#x201d;. The book is both a testament to the popularity of the revolution and the hard necessities imposed on Red Petrograd confronted with the White counterrevolution. He was working on Year Two when he was permitted to leave Stalin&#x2019;s Russia in 1936. The secret police decided to keep this manuscript and that of a complete novel, both of which disappeared from their archives."</p><br><p>&#x2014;Tariq Ali</p></p><h2>The Shape of the Journey: New &amp; Collected Poems</h2><p><p>Here is the definitive collection of poetry from one of America's best-loved writers-now available in paperback. With the publication of this book, eight volumes of poetry were brought back into print, including the early nature-based lyrics of <i>Plain Song</i>, the explosive <i>Outlyer &amp; Ghazals</i>, and the startling "correspondence" with a dead Russian poet in <i>Letters to Yesenin</i>. Also included is an introduction by Harrison, several previously uncollected poems, and "Geo-Bestiary," a 34-part paean to earthly passions. <i>The Shape of the Journey</i> confirms Jim Harrison's place among the most brilliant and essential poets writing today. </p><p>"Behind the words one always feels the presence of a passionate, exuberant man who is at the same time possessed of a quick, subtle intelligence and a deeply questioning attitude toward life.

A boat is smashed, a bathrobe is slashed, a car moves on its own and people are murdered. As evidence points to insanity in her cousin Jacqueline, Ann tries to uncover who is really behind these terrible tricks. After a series of dead ends and terrifying experiences where no one can be trusted, this suspenseful mystery comes to a surprising and unpredictable end.</p><p>Mabel Seeley was enormously popular in the 1940&#39;s. Her novels were published by Doubleday in New York and distributed nationally by The Crime Club. The Chuckling Fingers was promoted as the mystery of the year in 1941. Both of our reprints, The Chuckling Fingers and The Beckoning Door, have great new cover paintings by St. Paul artist Paul S. Kramer. We recommend them for mystery lovers of all ages as she is Minnesota&#39;s answer to Agatha Christie!Other people may think they'd like to live their lives over, but not me-not if this last week is going to be in it. Out of what has just happened at the Fingers both Jacqueline and I got something worth keeping, but heaven defend me from ever again having to stand helplessly by while it becomes more and more apparent to almost everyone but me that the person I love most in the world is murderously insane. Heaven forbid that I ever again see a car moving like Frankenstein, of its own power and volition, carrying a secret burden into a lake, or that I ever again grasp an arm and feel that rigid marble chill or that I ever again have to look on while a blood-drenched shirt is ripped away from the terrible red hole a bullet makes in living flesh. <p>I never again want to know the panic of being up against evil coming out of a mind so much more skillful than mine that even the signs we did see-the acid in a bride's toilet kit, the burned matchsticks under a bed, the word scrawled with a child's blue chalk on rock- all just bogged us deeper in terror and despair. I never again want to have a flying figure come hurtling at me from an unlit staircase or wake in the morning to find my bathrobe slashed or stand endless hours facing a door, fighting a vicarious fight. Any time in my life is going to be too soon for me to want to feel again that I'm a member of a looming last-man's club, with death walking hooded in the night, relentless and remorseless and successful. </p><p>Someone, I suppose-some Heaton- will live on at Fiddler's Fingers. But it'll be all right with me to be away from that particular slash of water, that particular brush of wind, that near inhuman chuckle that came to sound like laughter at all law and right and civilization.</p></p><h2>The End of Wall Street</h2><p>Watch a Video <ul> <li> </li></ul> <p>Download the cheat sheet for Roger Lowenstein's <i>The End of Wall Street</i> �</p> <b> The roots of the mortgage bubble and the story of the Wall Street collapse-and the government's unprecedented response-from our most trusted business journalist.</b><br><br> <i>The End of Wall Street</i> is a blow-by-blow account of America's biggest financial collapse since the Great Depression. Drawing on 180 interviews, including sit-downs with top government officials and Wall Street CEOs, Lowenstein tells, with grace, wit, and razor-sharp understanding, the <i>full</i> story of the end of Wall Street as we knew it. Displaying the qualities that made <i>When Genius Failed</i> a timeless classic of Wall Street-his sixth sense for narrative drama and his unmatched ability to tell complicated financial stories in ways that resonate with the ordinary reader- Roger Lowenstein weaves a financial, economic, and sociological thriller that indicts America for succumbing to the siren song of easy debt and speculative mortgages.<br><br> <i>The End of Wall Street</i> is rife with historical lessons and bursting with fast-paced action. Lowenstein introduces his story with precisely etched, laserlike profiles of Angelo Mozilo, the Johnny Appleseed of subprime mortgages who spreads toxic loans across the landscape like wild crabapples, and moves to a damning explication of how rating agencies helped gift wrap faulty loans in the guise of triple-A paper and a takedown of the academic formulas that-once again- proved the ruin of investors and banks. Lowenstein excels with a series of searing profiles of banking CEOs, such as the ferretlike Dick Fuld of Lehman and the bloodless Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan, and of government officials from the restless, deal-obsessed Hank Paulson and the overmatched Tim Geithner to the cerebral academic Ben Bernanke, who sought to avoid a repeat of the one crisis he spent a lifetime trying to understand-the Great Depression.<br><br> Finally, we come to understand the majesty of Lowenstein's theme of liquidity and capital, which explains the origins of the crisis and that positions the collapse of 2008 as the greatest ever of Wall Street's unlearned lessons. <i>The End of Wall Street</i> will be essential reading as we work to identify the lessons of the market failure and start to reb...</p><p><p>Roger Lowenstein, author of the bestselling <i>Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist</i> and <i>When Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long-term Capital Management</i>, reported for the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> for more than a decade and wrote the Journal&#x2019;s stock market column &#x201c;Heard on the Street&#x201d; and also its &#x201c;Intrinsic Value&#x201d; column. He now contributes articles and reviews to the Journal and the <i>New York Times Magazine</i> and is a columnist for <i>SmartMoney Magazine</i>. He lives in Westfield, New Jersey.</p><p>In the late summer of 2008, as Lehman Brothers teetered at the edge, a bell tolled for Wall Street. The elite of American bankers were enlisted to try to save Lehman, but they were fighting for something larger than a venerable, 158-year-old institution. Steven Black, the veteran JPMorgan executive, had an impulse to start saving the daily newspapers, figuring that historic events were afoot. On Sunday, September 14, as the hours ticked away, Lehman&#x2019;s employees gathered at the firm, unwilling to say goodbye and fearful of what lay in wait. With bankruptcy a fait accompli, they slunk off to bars for a final toast, as people once did in advance of a great and terrible battle. One ventured that &#x201c;the forces of evil&#x201d; were about to be loosed on American society. Lehman&#x2019;s failure was the largest in American history and yet another financial firm, the insurer American International Group, was but hours away from an even bigger collapse. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two bulwarks of the mortgage industry, had just been seized by the federal government. Dozens of banks big and small were bordering on insolvency. And the epidemic of institutional failures did not begin to describe the crisis&#x2019;s true depth. The market system itself had come undone. Banks couldn&#x2019;t borrow; investors wouldn&#x2019;t lend; companies could not refinance. Millions of Americans were threatened with losing their homes. The economy, when it fully caught Wall Street&#x2019;s chill, would retrench as it had not done since the Great Depression. Millions lost their jobs and the stock market crashed (its worst fall since the 1930s). Home foreclosures broke every record; two of America&#x2019;s three automobile manufacturers filed for bankruptcy, and banks themselves failed by the score. Confidence in America&#x2019;s market system, thought to have attained the pinnacle of laissez-faire perfection, was shattered.</p> <p>The crisis prompted government interventions that only recently would have been considered unthinkable. Less than a generation after the fall of the Berlin Wall, when prevailing orthodoxy held that the free market could govern itself, and when financial regulation seemed destined for near irrelevancy, the United States was compelled to socialize lending and mortgage risk, and even the ownership of banks, on a scale that would have made Lenin smile. The massive fiscal remedies evidenced both the failure of an ideology and the eclipse of Wall Street&#x2019;s golden age. For years, American financiers had gaudily assumed more power, more faith in their ability to calculate&#x2014;and inoculate themselves against&#x2014;risk.</p> <p>As a consequence of this faith, banks and investors had plied the average American with mortgage debt on such speculative and unthinking terms that not just America&#x2019;s economy but the world&#x2019;s economy ultimately capsized. The risk grew from early in the decade, when little-known lenders such as Angelo Mozilo began to make waves writing subprime mortgages. Before long, Mozilo was to proclaim that even Americans who could not put money down should be &#x201c;lent&#x201d; the money for a home, and not long after that, Mozilo made it happen: homes for free.</p> <p>But in truth, the era began well before Mozilo and his ilk. Its seeds took root in the aftermath of the 1970s, when banking and markets were liberalized. Prior to then, finance was a static business that played merely a supporting role in the U.S. economy. America was an industrial state. Politicians, union leaders, and engineers were America&#x2019;s stars; investment bankers were gray and dull. In the postindustrial era, what we may call the Age of Markets, diplomats no longer adjusted currency values; Wall Street traders did. Just so, global capital markets allocated credit, and hordes of profitminded, if short-term-focused, investors decided which corporations would be bought and sold.</p> <p>Finance became a growth industry, fixated on new and complex securities. Wall Street developed a heretofore unimagined prowess for securitizing assets: student loans, consumer debts, and, above all, mortgages. Prosperity in this era was less evenly spread. Smokestack workers fell behind in the global competition, but financiers who mastered the intricacies of Wall Street soared on wings of gold. Finance now was anything but dull; markets were dynamic and ever changing. Average Americans clamored to keep pace; increasingly they resorted to borrowing. By happy accident, Wall Street had opened the spigot of credit. People discovered an unsuspected source of liquidity&#x2014;the ability to borrow on their homes. With global investors financing mortgages, ordinary families were suddenly awash in debt. The habit of saving, forged in the tentative prosperity that followed the war, gave way to rampant consumerism. By the late 2000s the typical American household had become a net borrower, fueled by credit from lessdeveloped countries such as China&#x2014;a curious inversion of the conventional rules.</p> <p>Paradoxically, the more license that was given to markets, the more that Wall Street called on bureaucrats for help. Market busts became a familiar feature of the age. Notwithstanding, it was the doctrine of the experts&#x2014;on Wall Street and in Washington&#x2014;that modern finance was a nearly pitch-perfect instrument. A preference for market solutions morphed into something close to blind faith in them. By the mid-2000s, when the spirit of the age attained its fullest, the very fact that markets had financed the leverage of banks, as well as the mortgages of individuals, was taken as proof that nothing could be wrong with that leverage, or nothing that government could or should try to restrict. Financiers had discovered the key to limiting risk, and central bankers, adherents to the cult of the market, had mastered the mysterious art of heading off depressions and even the normal ups and downs of the economic cycle. Or so it was believed.</p> <p>Then, Lehman&#x2019;s collapse opened a trapdoor on Wall Street from which poured forth all the hidden demons and excesses, intellectual and otherwise, that had been accumulating during the boom. The Street suffered the most calamitous week in its history, including a money market fund closure, a panic by hedge funds, and runs against the investment firms that still were standing. Thereafter, the Street and then the U.S. economy were stunned by near-continuous panics and failures, including runs on commercial banks, a freezing of credit, the leveling of the American workplace in the recession, and the sickening drop in the stock market.</p> <p>The first instinct was to blame Lehman (or the regulators who had failed to save it) for triggering the crisis. As the recession deepened, the thesis that one firm had caused the panic seemed increasingly tenuous. The trouble was not that so much followed Lehman, but that so much had preceded it. For more than a year, the excesses of the market age had been slowly deflating, in particular the bubble in home loans. Leverage had moved into reverse, and the process of deleveraging set off a fatal chain reaction.</p> <p>By the time Lehman filed for bankruptcy, the U.S. housing market, the singular driver of the U.S. economy, had collapsed. Indeed, by then the slump was old news. Home prices had been falling for nine consecutive quarters, and the rate of mortgage delinquencies over the preceding three years had trebled. In August, the month before Lehman failed, 303,000 homes were foreclosed on (up from 75,000 three years before).</p> <p>The especial crisis in subprime mortgages had been percolating for eighteen months, and the leading purveyors of these mortgages, having started to tumble early in 2007, were all, by the following September, either defunct, acquired, or on the critical list. Also, the subprime crisis had fully bled into Wall Street. Literally hundreds of billions of dollars of mortgages had been carved into exotic secondary securities, which had been stored on the books of the leading Wall Street banks, not to mention in investment portfolios around the globe. By September 2008, these securities had collapsed in value&#x2014;and with them, the banks&#x2019; equity and stock prices. Goldman Sachs, one of the <i>least</i>-affected banks, had lost a third of its market value; Morgan Stanley had been cut in half. And the Wall Street crisis had bled into Main Street. When Lehman toppled, total employment had already fallen by more than a million jobs. Steel, aluminum, and autos were all contracting. The National Bureau of Economic Research would conclude that the recession began in December 2007&#x2014;nine months ahead of the fateful days of September.</p> <p>On the evidence, Lehman was more nearly the climax, or one of a series of climaxes, in a long and painful cataclysm. By the time it failed, the critical moment was long past. Banks had suffered horrendous losses that drained them of their capital, and as the country was to discover, capitalism without capital is like a furnace without fuel. Promptly, the economy went cold. The recession mushroomed into the most devastating in postwar times. The modern financial system, in which markets rather than political authorities self-regulated risk-taking, for the first time truly failed. This was the result of a dark and powerful storm front that had long been gathering at Wall Street&#x2019;s shores. By the end of summer 2008, neither Wall Street nor the wider world could escape the imminent blow. To seek the sources of the crash, and even the causes, we must go back much further.</p></p><h2>Personal Geographies: Explorations in Mixed-Media Mapmaking</h2><p><b>Explore your Creative Self with Mixed-media Maps</b><br><br>You don't have to be a world traveler or a professional cartographer to embark on a grand journey of self-discovery through mapmaking. <i>Personal Geographies</i> gives you the tools and techniques you'll need to create artful maps of your self, your experiences and your personal journey.

She has begun to accept that that there is more to the world than can be explained by FBI training and forensic science.

Illusion and ritual duel with police procedures and science as Ella strives to find out who is destroying the heart of the tribe.</p></p><p><b>Aim�e and David Thurlo</b> have won the <i>RT Book Reviews </i>Career Achievement Award for their romantic suspense, the Willa Cather Award for Contemporary Fiction, and the New Mexico Book Award.

He lives in Corrales, New Mexico, and often makes appearances at area bookstores.<p><strong>ONE</strong><br>Special Investigator Ella Clah stood in the doorway to her living room, nibbling on a slice of honeydew melon from her brother&#x2019;s garden. It was still early in the morning, but her mother was already helping Valerie Yazzie finish the velveteen wedding outfit Valerie&#x2019;s daughter would wear on her wedding day in less than a week.<br>Ella&#x2019;s mother looked up and smiled at her. Rose Destea was, like her daughter, taller than most Navajo women, and only a dozen or so pounds heavier than Ella. &#x201c;Take a break from all that paperwork you brought from the police department and have a decent breakfast. That&#x2019;s not the way to start a morning you&#x2019;re supposed to have off.&#x201d;<br>Ella shrugged. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a lot of work to get done. We&#x2019;ve had some major changes in the department. Our new police chief wants things done <em>his</em>way. He&#x2019;s determined to recapture the faith people had in us once.&#x201d;<br>Valerie Yazzie shook her head. The middle-aged Navajo woman wore a perpetual frown that had, through the years, become ingrained in her features. &#x201c;There were so many we trusted we shouldn&#x2019;t have. It&#x2019;s hard to forget how they betrayed the tribe.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But the department is clean now, and Big Ed Atcitty is going to make sure it stays that way. He&#x2019;s an excellent leader, and tough, but fair.&#x201d; Ella bit off another piece of the juicy melon and swallowed. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re just having to do a lot of work fast to put the changes he wants into effect.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What you find difficult, daughter, is doing things someone else&#x2019;s way,&#x201c; Rose said with a smile. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve always had definite opinions on how things should be handled.&#x201d;<br>Ella smiled grudgingly. &#x201c;Well, I suppose that&#x2019;s true.&#x201d;<br>Rose turned her attention back to the hem she was pinning. &#x201c;This is going to be such a lovely wedding dress!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be making one for your own daughter before too long,&#x201c; Valerie commented mischievously, nodding toward Ella. &#x201c;She will want to trade in her gun belt for a cradle board sooner or later.&#x201d;<br>Ella choked on the piece of melon and reached to the kitchen counter for a napkin. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t count on it.&#x201d;<br>Rose sighed and looked at Valerie. &#x201c;See how she is? I&#x2019;ve just about given up hope.&#x201d; She paused, then with a tiny smile added, &#x201c;but not quite.&#x201d;<br>As the telephone rang and interrupted them, Ella gave the phone company a mental high-five. She&#x2019;d been literally saved by the bell. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take that.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You might as well,&#x201c; Rose muttered. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s probably for you. They won&#x2019;t leave you alone, even on your morning off. I never get any calls in my own home anymore.&#x201d;<br>Ella chose not to comment. It was an old argument. Her mother couldn&#x2019;t understand her dedication to police work and the incredible sense of purpose it gave her. In truth, she found it difficult to explain to anyone. Only another cop could understand that addiction to the incredible highs and lows of the work; the need to restore order to a world that resisted at every turn. Ella walked down the hall to her room, closed the door, and answered the phone.<br>&#x201c;Hold for Police Chief Atcitty, please,&#x201c; said the crisp voice of Big Ed&#x2019;s secretary.<br>Ella sat on the edge of her bed, waiting. More than eight months had passed since she&#x2019;d resigned from the FBI and moved back to the Rez to stay with her widowed mother. She gazed around her room, lost in memories. Most of what was around her was less than a year old. The fire, months back, had spared the house but ruined everything she&#x2019;d left behind from her youth. All traces of the girl she&#x2019;d once been were gone now, and she had more than a decade&#x2019;s worth of new memories and new mementos to replace them. She stared pensively at her framed FBI diploma and gilded marksmanship trophies on the shelf. Last in line was a recent photo showing her being sworn in as a tribal police officer.<br>Ella was hard pressed to say which of her career achievements filled her with the most un-Navajo-like pride, but she was definitely proud of her new job. It had been created especially for her, here on the Navajo Rez, and it required her own special skills. She was special investigator for the Navajo Police, and answered only to Big Ed. The job gave her the autonomy she&#x2019;d dreamed of throughout her career, though on the downside, the paperwork load was pretty incredible.<br>&#x201c;Shorty, you there?&#x201d; a familiar gravelly voice asked.<br>&#x201c;Yes, Big Ed. What&#x2019;s going down?&#x201d; Ella was getting used to the nickname Big Ed had given her, although she stood a head taller than her boss and most other Navajo men as well.<br>Big Ed had been given his nickname because he was shaped like a barrel with arms. Stories around the station claimed Big Ed had never been knocked off his feet by a perp. She believed them.<br>&#x201c;I need you to drive over to what we&#x2019;ve always called Red Flint Pass, though it&#x2019;s getting yet another name now. Maybe you know it as Washington Pass. A college history class was supposed to meet there. Seems someone murdered Kee Dodge out there before his students arrived.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Kee Dodge, the historian?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah. His students showed up this morning for class and, from what I hear, stumbled upon the body. Get over there and take up the case. I&#x2019;d like a preliminary report before lunch. I&#x2019;ve called the M.E. She&#x2019;ll meet you there along with our crime-scene team. We have a patrol officer in the area already. He&#x2019;ll give you whatever backup you need.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m out the door, Big Ed.&#x201d;<br>Ella reached for her gun belt and adjusted the pancake holster so that it lay flat against her waist. Beneath a jacket, her weapon barely showed, and that was great for plainclothes work. Fitting her .22 backup pistol inside her custom-made boot strap, she strode out of her room.<br>&#x201c;I have to be going now. I&#x2019;m not sure when I&#x2019;ll be back,&#x201c; Ella called out to her mother, waving to Valerie as she passed through the living room.<br>&#x201c;So, what else is new?&#x201d; Rose said with a sigh. &#x201c;Just be careful.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Always.&#x201d;<br>Ella went to her navy blue unmarked Jeep. It was the perfect vehicle for the kind of rough terrain that comprised most of the Navajo nation. She took the map from the glove compartment and checked the route. It would be a fifty-minute ride at posted speeds, but she could knock a good ten minutes off that in a hurry. She opted for the hurry, knowing that a fresh crime scene would yield the most information.<br>The drive south on Highway 666 was almost a straight line, but once she turned west at Sheep Springs, Ella had to slow down a bit. Soon the road turned to gravel, and her Jeep left a long, serpentine dust trail as it climbed the mountain road.<br>When Ella arrived, several vehicles were already parked on both sides of the road. Jimmy Frank, a young but experienced patrolman, was questioning one student. Her gaze then shifted to the half-dozen young adults some distance away, silently awaiting their turn to be questioned. They were dressed casually in jeans, like college students anywhere. Jimmy was going with established procedures, not letting the words of one witness shape another&#x2019;s.<br>She studied the officer for a moment. Jimmy was in his early thirties, yet he looked so different from the way he had at sixteen, except for the slight belly that pushed against his shirt, hinting at what would come with middle age.<br>As Ella approached the crime scene, she noted the body was facedown next to the driver&#x2019;s side of a pickup parked about fifteen feet off the road. The students and patrolman were staying as far away from it as possible, although Officer Frank had positioned himself facing the scene so he could ask relevant questions while keeping the crime scene under observation. Logic and cultural beliefs were destined to continue clashing inside them for another generation at least. Ella knew that she would not be the last to have to try and live in two overlapping worlds. Even among the new generation of Navajos, fear of the <em>chindi</em>remained, though most would outwardly deny it.<br>Ella nodded to Jimmy, who continued his interview, keeping the witnesses away from the scene. Walking in a slow, inward spiral around the pickup, Ella studied the ground around the crime scene, making a visual search for evidence. Carefully selecting where she stepped, she finally arrived at the body. There were no recognizable tracks here on the hard ground so close to the road.<br>As Ella got her first close-up look at the corpse, bile rose to the back of her throat. Blood had begun to cake the gravelly earth beneath the head and neck of the body. The victim&#x2019;s skull had been bludgeoned, and the soft, pulpy matter from within the wound mingled with sharp pieces of bone, giving it the appearance of carelessly ground beef.<br>Ella forced herself to gulp several deep lungfuls of air, grateful that her sense of smell was the least stimulated by what she saw. She crouched next to the body, forcing herself to think clearly and calmly, relying on her training and the memory that this was not the worst corpse she&#x2019;d ever seen. Kee lay chest down. From what she could see, he&#x2019;d been strangled with leather shoelaces, probably after being hit on the head with some kind of tool or club. From the look of the head wound, the strangling had probably been a waste of time.<br>Although Dodge&#x2019;s back was to her, his face was turned to the right. She noted that his right eye was being held open by an object that had been imbedded in it. It was a piece of something hard and white, discolored at the entry point by blood and aqueous fluid. She leaned closer, trying to figure out what it was, suppre...</p></p><h2>The Cold War: A Military History</h2><p><p>Even fifteen years after the end of the Cold War, it is still hard to grasp that we no longer live under its immense specter. For nearly half a century, from the end of World War II to the early 1990s, all world events hung in the balance of a simmering dispute between two of the greatest military powers in history. Hundreds of millions of people held their collective breath as the United States and the Soviet Union, two national ideological entities, waged proxy wars to determine spheres of influence&#x2013;and millions of others perished in places like Korea, Vietnam, and Angola, where this cold war flared hot.</p><p>Such a consideration of the Cold War&#x2013;as a military event with sociopolitical and economic overtones&#x2013;is the crux of this stellar collection of twenty-six essays compiled and edited by Robert Cowley, the longtime editor of MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of Military History. Befitting such a complex and far-ranging period, the volume&#x2019;s contributing writers cover myriad angles. John Prados, in &#x201c;The War Scare of 1983,&#x201d; shows just how close we were to escalating a war of words into a nuclear holocaust. Victor Davis Hanson offers &#x201c;The Right Man,&#x201d; his pungent reassessment of the bellicose air-power zealot Curtis LeMay as a man whose words were judged more critically than his actions.</p><p>The secret war also gets its due in George Feiffer&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Berlin Tunnel,&#x201d; which details the charismatic C.I.A. operative &#x201c;Big Bill&#x201d; Harvey&#x2019;s effort to tunnel under East Berlin and tap Soviet phone lines&#x2013;and the Soviets&#x2019; equally audacious reaction to the plan; while &#x201c;The Truth About Overflights,&#x201d; by R. Cargill Hall, sheds light on some of the Cold War&#x2019;s best-kept secrets.</p><p>The often overlooked human cost of fighting the Cold War finds a clear voice in &#x201c;MIA&#x201d; by Marilyn Elkins, the widow of a Navy airman, who details the struggle to learn the truth about her husband, Lt. Frank C. Elkins, whose A-4 Skyhawk disappeared over Vietnam in 1966. In addition there are profiles of the war&#x2019;s &#x201c;front lines&#x201d;&#x2013;Dien Bien Phu, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Bay of Pigs&#x2013;as well as of prominent military and civil leaders from both sides, including Harry S. Truman, Nikita Khrushchev, Dean Acheson, Gen. Douglas MacArthur, Richard M. Nixon, Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, and others.</p><p>Encompassing so many perspectives and events, <i>The Cold War</i> succeeds at an impossible task: illuminating and explaining the history of an undeclared shadow war that threatened the very existence of humankind.<br><br></p></p><p>Robert Cowley is the founding editor of MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of Military History.

He lives in Connecticut.Chapter 1<br><br> First Skirmishes<br><br> The Day the Cold War Started<br><br> James Chace<br><br> On May 7, 1945, at General Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x2019;s headquarters at Rheims in France, Germany surrendered unconditionally to the Allies, formally ending almost six years of war in Europe. It took less than a year, three seasons only, for the Grand Alliance of the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union to fall apart, and with it, lasting hopes of a peaceful international order. In that time the Soviets had swallowed much of Eastern Europe, and the West was beginning to accept, however reluctantly, the inevitability of a divided continent. The Soviets were also occupying northern Iran and were threatening to extend their influence, if not their outright domination, to the Persian Gulf. But as the year 1946 began, no country felt the menace of Soviet expansionist pressure more than Turkey. The Russians were asking&#x2014;demanding, rather&#x2014;to be allowed to establish naval and army bases in the Bosporus and Dardanelles. Would control of the eastern end of the Mediterranean be next? Soviet troops began to mass on the borders with Turkey.<br><br> As early as January 5, 1946, the new American president, Harry S. Truman, worried out loud to his secretary of state, James Byrnes, that the Soviets intended to invade Turkey. &#x201c;Unless Russia is faced with an iron fist and strong language,&#x201d; Truman said, &#x201c;another war is in the making.&#x201d; Then he added (and remember, this was a time when the American armed forces were demobilizing thousands of men each day), &#x201c;Only one language do they understand&#x2014;&#x2018;How many divisions have you?&#x2019;&#x201d; A month later, the Soviet ruler, Joseph Stalin, gave a speech announcing a new five-year plan. He went on to attack capitalism and to remark threateningly that his nation should be prepared for &#x201c;all kinds of eventualities.&#x201d; Back in Washington, Justice William O. Douglas remarked to the secretary of the navy, James Forrestal, that Stalin&#x2019;s speech sounded like &#x201c;the declaration of World War III.&#x201d;<br><br> The gloves were off. The former British prime minister, Winston Churchill, spoke at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, on March 5; Truman introduced him. &#x201c;From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic,&#x201d; Churchill said, &#x201c;an Iron Curtain has descended across the Continent.&#x201d; His words were not a call for war&#x2014;not yet&#x2014;but a counsel of preparedness. The time had come to check Soviet expansionism. &#x201c;From what I have seen of our Russian friends and allies during the war, I am convinced that there is nothing they admire so much as strength, and there is nothing for which they have less respect than for weakness, especially military weakness.&#x201d; Stalin could not let the Fulton speech go without a public comment: &#x201c;Mr. Churchill is now in the position of a firebrand of war.&#x201d;<br><br> Truman&#x2019;s January 5 outburst, Stalin&#x2019;s February broadside, or Churchill&#x2019;s Missouri warning: One might pick any number of symbolic days when the ideological and military struggle that was to consume the world for the next forty-five years began. James Chace, the biographer of Dean Acheson, argues that the pride of date belongs to August 19, 1946. That was the day when the Truman administration publicly rejected Stalin&#x2019;s call for joint Soviet-Turkish defense of the Straits&#x2014;and backed up its words by dispatching a naval task force to Istanbul. For the first time (and not for the last), the United States had proclaimed to the Soviets that, to protect its interests, it was not afraid to resort to arms.<br><br> JAMES CHACE, who died in the fall of 2004, was a distinguished historian, foreign policy analyst, editor, and teacher. He is best known for his biography, Dean Acheson: The Secretary of State Who Created the American World, as well as several books on international affairs, including Solvency, America Invulnerable (with Caleb Carr), The Consequences of the Peace, and a memoir, What We Had. His final book was 1912: Wilson, Roosevelt, Taft &amp; Debs&#x2014;the Election That Changed the Country. The former managing editor of Foreign Affairs and editor in chief of World Policy Journal, Chace was the Henry Luce Professor in Freedom of Inquiry and Expression at Bard College.</p><h2>Egermeie&#39;s Bible Story Book</h2><p>EGERMEIERS BIBLE STORY BOOK-SC</p><p></p><h2>The Guardship (The Brethren of the Coast #1)</h2><p><p>Shortly after Thomas Marlowe's arrival in Williamsburg, Virginia, all in that newfound capital city are speaking his name.

This authoritative guide showcases the finest papers in the world today. In clear and engaging language, Silvie Turner conveys the excitement of discovering sheets one never knew existed. Her book is an international compendium for artists, designers, and crafts people who want to know about fine papers--where and how they are made, their character, what they can be used for, and where to find them. The essence of each paper is discussed in detail, concentrating on handmades but also covering moldmades and fine machinemades. The author explains their manufacture, then provides descriptions and, in most cases, full specifications for each named paper. She advises on practicalities--how to store, fold, cut, tear, paste, preserve, and repair paper--and considers their uses, looking at dedicated sheets (for watercolor, drawing, etching, bookmaking, computer output) as well as decorative stock. The color plates display the rich diversity of papers--from shades of white and neutral to the intense hues of dyed stock, from fine-grained sheets through delicate papers with flowers and grasses to wild and rough Costa Rican handmades. Illustrations in the text show ingredients that go into paper and methods used in countries throughout the world. Best of all, firsthand experience of modern fine papers is provided by a selection of samples, mounted so that their weight and texture can be felt. The book includes an explanation of sizes and weights, a glossary, and full indexes. A special feature is the comprehensive list of makers, sellers, and sources of information about paper.</p><p>Silvie Turner has been involved with specialist papers for twenty-five years and is the author of numerous books and articles on the subject, including Which Paper?, the forerunner of this much larger and more comprehensive volume.Virtually any question about the use, selection, care, production, or availability of handmade or fine machine-made paper has an answer somewhere in this compendium of paper lore. Designed as a resource for artists, paper makers, or anyone concerned with archival paper use, this work presents brief descriptions of the varied paper making of Europe, the Americas, and Asia along with an extensive country-by-country listing of paper producers and the particulars of all the types of paper that each mill offers. Along the way, we learn hundreds of paper-making terms (more than 150 in Japanese alone) and gain an appreciation of the history of paper making and fiber preparation. Technical discussions of the specific paper characteristics affecting usage for purposes as diverse as watercolor and computer printing are clear and to the point. The only disappointment is that the 18 paper samples included in a fold inside the cover?sure to disappear from libraries?are too few after our appetites have been whetted. Essential for every library with artists as patrons and also of interest to preservation departments.?David McClelland, Philadelphia<br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Coyote Summer (Man From Boston)</h2><p><p>Upper Missouri River, 1825</p><p>Against the wild grandeur of the Rocky mountains and a richly woven tapestry of Indian cultures--Sioux, Mandan, Crow, Shoshoni--<i>Coyote Summer</i> unfolds into an unforgettable tale of love and reconciliation, destiny, and the indomitable spirit.</p><p>No two people could be more different: Heals Like A Willow, a beautiful young Shoshoni medicine woman, and Richard Hamilton, a Harvard philosophy student new to the frontier. Though they come from worlds apart, hindered by vastly different cultures, their souls have met and will not be denied.</p><p>But Willow has ties to the Spirit world and a responsibility to her people. In visions she has seen the coming White Storm brewing in the East--the endless stream of settlers overrunning the land, pouring ever westward.

Even if it means leaving behind the one who has taken her heart.</p><p>Armed only with his philosophy, meaningless in the harsh reality of the Rockies, Richard sets out after her.

In fact, <i>Coyote Summer</i> may be the better story of the two. Certainly, it doesn't lack for excitement...Gear succeeds in creating something more than a mere historical novel." --<i>Roundup</i> magazine</p>In Coyote Summer, W. Michael Gear returns to a vanished America - a time when the last great Indian nations lived in unfettered freedom. In the path of cataclysmic change, two people, bound by forbidden love, must face the terrible truth about themselves, their peoples, and their most cherished principles. Heals Like A Willow has traveled with the white traders, learned their ways, and finally returned to her remote mountain people. As the White Storm brews beyond the eastern horizon, Willow struggles to prepare her people for the onslaught. But plagued by her ties to the Spirit World and her broken-hearted love for a misfit white man, Willow finds few who will heed her warnings. Richard Hamilton&#39;s education in philosophy hadn&#39;t prepared him for the hard reality of life beyond the frontier. Now, his philosophical beliefs shattered, he faces the brutal winter wilderness - a man alone, armed only with his wits and his dogged determination to discover an elusive truth. Willow holds the key - if he can ever find her in such a vast expanse of mountains and snow.</p><h2>10 Gifts of Wisdom: What Every Child Must Know Before They Leave Home</h2><p>Every parent wants their child to grow into a gracious and competent adult.

Tour.</p><p><b>Jennifer Egan</b>, author of the<i> Invisible Circus</i>, recently received a Guggenheim Fellowship for her work. Her stories and nonfiction have appeared in T<i>he New Yorker, GQ, Mademoiselle, Ploughshares, </i>and <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>. She lives in New York City.<br>Ranging in setting from provincial China to downtown Manhattan, the 11 short stories in Egan's first collection trace characters grappling with a wide variety of backgrounds and situations. But whether portraying the ennervated atmosphere of an exotic fashion shoot in Africa ("The Stylist") or a teen's discovery of her father's secret life ("Puerto Vallarta"), Egan's writing is even more assured and convincing than it was in her debut novel, The Invisible Circus. In the chilling "Sacred Heart," about a young girl's obsessive infatuation with her school's premier self-destructive rebel, Egan manages to sustain an atmosphere charged with menace without resorting to predictable shock effects. Many of the tales concern Americans abroad, characters who are disconnected from both their present environments and from the lives they've left behind. This theme finds its most persuasive expression in the dazzling "Why China?" in which a troubled San Francisco financial trader encounters the con man who once cheated him out of $25,000. With remarkable economy, Egan develops an uneasy cat-and-mouse game between the two men, as well as a rare depth of characterization for such a short work. While a smattering of the tales here seem like apprentice work by comparison-the title story, for instance, which concerns a hyper-trendy photographer's assistant in Manhattan-the collection as a whole showcases Egan as a writer of admirable ambition and accomplishment. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>M.Y.T.H.

It points out that when writing began in Mesopotamia it was not, as previously thought, a sudden and spontaneous invention. Instead, it was the outgrowth of many thousands of years' worth of experience at manipulating symbols.</p> <p>In Volume I: From Counting to Cuneiform, Denise Schmandt-Besserat describes how in about 8000 B.C., coinciding with the rise of agriculture, a system of counters, or tokens, appeared in the Near East. These tokens&#x2014;small, geometrically shaped objects made of clay&#x2014;represented various units of goods and were used to count and account for them. The token system was a breakthrough in data processing and communication that ultimately led to the invention of writing about 3100 B.C. Through a study of archaeological and epigraphic evidence, Schmandt-Besserat traces how the Sumerian cuneiform script, the first writing system, emerged from a counting device.</p> <p>In Volume II: A Catalog of Near Eastern Tokens, Schmandt-Besserat presents the primary data on which she bases her theories. These data consist of several thousand tokens, catalogued by country, archaeological site, and token types and subtypes. The information also includes the chronology, stratigraphy, museum ownership, accession or field number, references to previous publications, material, and size of the artifacts. Line drawings and photographs illustrate the various token types.</p></p><p>Before Writing gives a new perspective on the evolution of communication.

Denise Schmandt-Besserat presents a system of counters (tokens) that appeared in the Near East following the invention of agriculture (about 8000 B.C.) as the immediate precursor of Sumerian writing. Tokens were small objects modeled in clay in various geometric forms used for counting and accounting for goods. They remained in use during 5,000 years with little change, except at the rise of cities, when the types multiplied. The tokens represented a breakthrough in communication. They constituted the first code, the first system of signs for communication. They made it possible to deal concurrently with multiple kinds of data, thus allowing the processing of a volume and complexity of information never reached previously. Tokens functioned as an extension of the human brain to collect, manipulate, store, and retrieve data. In turn, processing an increasing volume of data brought people to think in greater abstraction. Before Writing discusses how the tokens reflect an archaic way of &#34;concrete counting&#34; that paved the way to abstract counting. The evolution of the token system was also tied to the development of political power, since accounting was key to the control of real goods. Before Writing documents how numeracy was the privilege of an elite and shows how the more complex the token system became the more power it wielded. Written in an engaging and lively style, Before Writing, Volume I: From Counting to Cuneiform has significance far beyond a single field. It will be of interest to scholars and general readers interested in the origin of civilization, communication, and mathematics. A companion volume, Before Writing, Volume II: A Catalog of Near Eastern Tokens, is also available and contains the primary data on which Schmandt-Besserat bases her theories.Denise Schmandt-Besserat is Professor of Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Texas at Austin.</p><h2>Zen Imagery Exercises: Meridian Exercises for Wholesome Living</h2><p>Argues that exercise can help with the body-mind integration, discusses imagery, breathing, relaxation and meridians, and demonstrates useful exercises</p><p></p><h2>Netherland: A Novel</h2><p>In a New York City made phantasmagorical by the events of 9/11, Hans--a banker originally from the Netherlands--finds himself marooned among the strange occupants of the Chelsea Hotel after his English wife and son return to London. Alone and untethered, feeling lost in the country he had come to regard as home, Hans stumbles upon the vibrant New York subculture of cricket, where he revisits his lost childhood and, thanks to a friendship with a charismatic and charming Trinidadian named Chuck Ramkissoon, begins to reconnect with his life and his adopted country. Ramkissoon, a Gatsby-like figure who is part idealist and part operator, introduces Hans to an &#x201c;other&#x201d; New York populated by immigrants and strivers of every race and nationality. Hans is alternately seduced and instructed by Chuck&#x2019;s particular brand of naivete and chutzpah--by his ability to a hold fast to a sense of American and human possibility in which Hans has come to lose faith. <br><br><i>Netherland </i>gives us both a flawlessly drawn picture of a little-known New York and a story of much larger, and brilliantly achieved ambition: the grand strangeness and fading promise of 21st century America from an outsider&#x2019;s vantage point, and the complicated relationship between the American dream and the particular dreamers. Most immediately, though, it is the story of one man--of a marriage foundering and recuperating in its mystery and ordinariness, of the shallows and depths of male friendship, of mourning and memory.

The desert is itself a character in <b>The Sheltering Sky</b>, the most famous of Bowles' books, which is about three young Americans of the postwar generation who go on a walkabout into Northern Africa's own arid heart of darkness. In the process, the veneer of their lives is peeled back under the author's psychological inquiry.<p>When <em>The Sheltering Sky</em> was first published in 1949, it established Paul Bowles as one of the most singular and promising writers of the postwar generation. Its startlingly original vision has withstood the test of time and confirmed Tennessee Williams's early estimation: "<em>The Sheltering Sky</em> alone of the books that I have . . . read by American authors appears to bear the spiritual imprint of recent history in the western world." In this classic work of psychological terror, Bowles examines the ways in which Americans apprehend an alien culture and the ways in which their incomprehension destroys them.</p><p>The story of three worldly young travelers Port Moresby, his wife, Kit, and their friend, Tunner--adrift in the cities and deserts of North Africa after World War II, <em>The Sheltering Sky</em> is merciless in its evocation of the emotional dislocation induced by a foreign setting. As the Americans embark on an ill-fated journey through desolate terrain, they are pushed to the limits of human reason and intelligence by the unfathomable emptiness and impassive cruelty of the desert. Along the way, they encounter a host of enigmatic characters whose inarticulate strangeness seals the travelers off even more completely from the culture in which they are traveling, causing their fierce attachments to one another to unravel.</p><p>This special fiftieth anniversary commemorative edition of Bowles's unforgettable first novel includes the original <em>New York Times</em> review by Tennessee Williams and a preface the author wrote for his first novel before he died in 1999.</p></p><h2>Ode to Color: The Ten Essential Palettes for Living and Design</h2><p><p>Internationally renowned textile designer Lori Weitzner presents a novel, layered perspective on the use and significance of color in design and culture in this spectacular treasury illustrated with 225 full-color images.</p><p><em>Ode to Color</em>, a stunning anthology by renowned and award-winning textile and wallcovering designer Lori Weitzner, principal of Lori Weitzner Design, Inc., offers an immersive, sensual, and engaging journey in the world of color as it applies to culture, design, mood, and memory.

All animals, human or otherwise, thrive when they mimic key elements of life in their natural habitat. From diet to movement to sleep, this evolutionary perspective sheds light on some of our most pressing health concerns. What is causing the rise of chronic conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, and depression? Is eating red meat going to kill you? Is avoiding the sun actually the best way to avoid skin cancer?<br>&nbsp;<br>Durant takes readers on a thrilling ride to the Paleolithic and beyond, unlocking the health secrets of our ancient ancestors. What do obese gorillas teach us about weight loss? How can Paleolithic skulls contain beautiful sets of teeth? Why is the Bible so obsessed with hygiene? What do NASA astronauts teach us about getting a good night&#x2019;s sleep? And how are Silicon Valley techies hacking the human body?<br>&nbsp;<br>Blending science and culture, anthropology and philosophy, John Durant distills the lessons from his adventures and shows how to apply them to day-to-day life, teaching people how to construct their own personal &#x201c;habitat&#x201d; that will enable them to thrive. The book doesn&#x2019;t just address what we eat, but why we eat it; not just how to exercise, but the purpose of functional movement; not just being healthy, but leading a purposeful life.<br>&nbsp;<br>Combining the best of ancient wisdom with cutting edge science, Durant crafts a vision of health that is both fresh and futuristic.</p></p><p><p>JOHN DURANT is a leader of the growing ancestral health movement.

He blogs at HunterGatherer.com</p>1<br><br>Becoming the Caveman<br><br>What would it look like if a caveman were interviewed on TV? America was about to find out. On February 3, 2010, I was backstage at The Colbert Report, waiting to be interviewed by the razor-sharp comedian. Colbert's interviews are among the most difficult on television--and it was going to be my first ever TV appearance.<br><br>Colbert had invited me on because of my so-called caveman diet. Admittedly, my health regimen sounds unusual at first. I attempt to mimic aspects of life during the Stone Age--or, as many people jokingly refer to it, "living like a caveman." Heck, I even look the part, with a shaggy mane and scruffy beard.<br><br>In popular culture the "caveman in civilization" is a reliable source of punch lines. In 2004 GEICO ran an award-winning series of commercials showing a pair of well-dressed cavemen offended at the insurance company's tagline, "So easy a caveman can do it." On Saturday Night Live in the mid-nineties, Phil Hartman played Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer, a thawed Neanderthal who enrolled in law school and won over juries by pretending to be a simpleton ("Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'm just a caveman!") before delivering the clinching argument.<br><br>The jokes begin as soon as people find out about my lifestyle. Whenever I use a piece of modern technology (a cell phone, a Styrofoam cup, a spoon), someone reminds me, "Cavemen didn't use those!" People tease me about the caveman approach to dating: clubbing a girl over the head and dragging her by the hair back to my apartment. And if I ever eat anything other than raw meat straight off the bone, my co-workers kindly inform me that I am doing it all wrong. Apparently, watching reruns of The Flintstones turns anyone into an expert paleoanthropologist.<br><br>Given the widely held cartoonish perspective of Stone Age life, I had a pretty good idea of what kind of jokes to expect from Colbert. My job was to point out that our impression of how humans lived in the Stone Age is exactly that: a cartoon. In the same way that Mickey and Minnie Mouse tell us little about the lives of real mice, The Flintstones tells us little about the lives of real Stone Age humans. In fact, the terms "caveman" and "Stone Age" are inaccurate and outdated. Though some early humans lived in caves, particularly in cold or mountainous climates such as Europe, our Paleolithic ancestors lived for millions of years underneath the big open sky of the African savannah.<br><br>These early humans were hunter-gatherers who foraged for a variety of wild foods, and whose lifestyle was quite different from the lives people lead today. This ancient, ancestral lifestyle is more important than we realize--especially when it comes to being healthy in the modern world.<br><br>Here's the simple truth: genetically speaking, we're all hunter-gatherers.<br><br>Of course, we're not just hunter-gatherers. We also carry the genes of primates; herders and farmers; factory workers and explorers; office workers and computer programmers. But at our biological core we are still largely hunters and gatherers.<br><br>My path to discovering my inner hunter-gatherer began during my junior year at college. Two important but seemingly unrelated events took place at the same time. First, I went through a long breakup with a girlfriend and watched my physical and mental health suffer. Second, I began studying under cognitive psychologist Dr. Steven Pinker, learning about the evolution of the human mind over millions of years and how that evolutionary history shapes the way our minds work today.<br><br>In the middle of the breakup I had an epiphany: If I got fewer than eight hours of sleep, it felt like my world was coming to an end. But on the days when I got more than eight hours of sleep (and exercised), I was able to put it all behind me. It blew my mind that my entire outlook on a relationship could be so noticeably influenced by my bedtime. Rather than having a mind or spirit that rose above my base body, it seemed like I was nothing more than a bunch of cells and chemicals sloshing around in a big, leaky sack.<br><br>As the geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky said, "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution." Pinker's course on evolutionary biology examined the capacities of the human mind through the lens of the survival and reproductive pressures faced by our ancestors. It addressed questions like "Why do many people have a visceral fear of snakes, which kill only a few people each year, but not of automobiles, which kill tens of thousands of people each year?"<br><br>Evolutionary theory points out that snakes were a real and deadly threat to our ancestors--but automobiles were not. Our ancestors with an innate fear of snakes would have been less likely to risk a deadly encounter with one, and thus would have been more likely to produce more offspring. This hypothesis wasn't just an after the fact rationalization of a fear. The fear of snakes is widespread among other primates, which share similar predators. The same line of thinking can be used to explain a variety of common fears that were past evolutionary threats, such as darkness, deep water, and heights. The power of the human mind is such that instinctual fears can be overcome (and novel fears can be imprinted), but the predisposition still looms in our minds.<br><br>Evolutionary psychology can also explain some of our moral intuitions. For example, why is there an almost universal aversion to incest? Inbreeding is far more likely to result in birth defects; just ask the owner of a purebred dog. In our evolutionary past, people with an aversion to having sex with their close kin would have been more likely to produce fertile and healthy offspring. Cultural norms almost always reinforced this instinctual aversion to incest, even though people may not have understood why the norms existed. They just worked, and the people who held such norms ended up flourishing.<br><br>This newfound perspective redirected my entire course of study halfway through college. I shifted away from my major, history, and toward evolutionary psychology, culminating in an interdisciplinary thesis advised by Pinker. I wanted to explore mankind's murky origins--and their lingering effects on us today.<br><br>Then I graduated. I moved to the urban jungle and joined the daily grind. Abstract ideas about cavemen gave way to the concrete reality of paying the rent on a cave-like apartment in New York City.<br><br>I worked long hours, including weekends, at a consulting firm. My company would buy takeout when I worked late, which meant I ate takeout almost every night. I sat most of the day and rarely found time to exercise. I didn't sleep enough, and when I had the opportunity I usually went out drinking with friends. "Work hard, play hard" meant being hard on my health all the time.<br><br>Like most others starting their first desk job, I found that my metabolism seemed to slow down in a big way. I gained about twenty pounds of solid fat. This actually didn't bother me that much. I had been lean before, and now I was "normal" (meaning, kind of hefty). To me the more important issue was my energy level: It was up and down. I often couldn't even stay awake, let alone function productively, without large amounts of caffeine.<br><br>Just like during that breakup, as my energy went, so went my mood. Low energy meant pessimism, impatience, irritability. High energy meant optimism, confidence, and an upbeat perspective. My outlook, my judgment, my decisions--things that were central to who I was as a person--seemed to be influenced by something as simple as what I had eaten for lunch (often a footlong Subway meatball sub) and whether I had made a Starbucks run.<br><br>I don't know why it took me so long to make the connection--it certainly wasn't a lack of coffee--but one day I considered the situation in a new light. Could I take control of my health and diet in order to improve my mood and outlook? Could I be "up" all the time?<br><br>I began where most people who want to get healthier begin: my diet. Maybe, as so many nutritionists advise, I needed to nibble on lots of small snacks throughout the day to keep my blood sugar up. Or maybe my metabolism was just naturally slowing down due to age. Or maybe I was eating too much fat or too many calories. Or maybe I was supposed to eat organic. Regardless, I knew I had to eat healthier--which is what most people would call "going on a diet." But I had never been on a diet in my life.<br><br>As any rugged man age eighteen to thirty-five can tell you, diets are for women and organic food is for hippies. The only time I had ever counted calories in a meal was to brag about how many I had just eaten. If I was weighing myself, it was probably because I wanted to gain weight (i.e., muscle). It's not as if the diet industry had a great track record of success. From an outsider's perspective, it seemed like a constant churn of celebrity-endorsed double-talk that gets renamed, repackaged, and resold to desperate women straight out of a Cathy cartoon. Ack!<br><br>I needed a scientific framework that worked and made sense. I needed something that had the power to explain why.<br><br>That "something" popped into my inbox at 4:01 P.M. on February 14, 2006. It came attached to an email from my older brother Clark, who sent me a twenty-six-page essay by Dr. Art De Vany, a retired economist from the University of California. De Vany titled his essay "Evolutionary Fitness." The title was an academic pun: it referred to "fitness" in the common definition of exercise, as well as "fitness" in the evolutionary biology sense of reproductive fitness, meaning an organism's overall ability to leave offspring.<br><br>The essay was based on a simple premise: There is a mismatch between our genes and the lives that we lead today.<br><br>Humans aren't adapted to sitting at desks all day long, eating Twinkies and drinking Pepsi. Humanity spent most of its evolutionary existence living as hunter-gatherers on the African savannah; therefore humanity was better adapted to that type of lifestyle. Many modern health problems, such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, are rare to nonexistent among contemporary hunter-gatherers. Our hunter-gatherer ancestors were healthier and lived longer than most people realize. If we wanted to be healthy, then we might be able to learn a thing or two from them.<br><br>Old knowledge didn't need to be wrong knowledge.<br><br>The general mismatch hypothesis wasn't original to De Vany. A wide variety of academics and authors had written about a disconnect between our ancestral lifestyles and our current ones, but in the age-old scientific tradition of self-experimentation, De Vany was one of the first to take it out of the classroom, apply it to his own diet and exercise, and then share his experience with others online.<br><br>Because I had studied evolutionary psychology, the general evolutionary approach to health immediately struck a chord with me. Instead of reading a diet book to learn about what to eat, I could find out what humans naturally ate. Lions are well adapted to a carnivorous diet. Gorillas are well adapted to an herbivorous diet. Humans are well adapted to an omnivorous diet, based on the foods eaten by hunter-gatherers.<br><br>Online I discovered a small but growing group of people who were "eating paleo," and, more broadly, following a paleo lifestyle. But what did that actually mean?<br><br>Not only did eating paleo imply avoiding processed foods, as most conventional health authorities recommend, but it also meant casting a skeptical eye on allegedly "healthy" agricultural foods like whole grains and legumes (wheat, corn, soy) and dairy (milk, yogurt, cheese), which didn't enter the human diet in any meaningful amount until the Agricultural Revolution roughly 10,000 years ago. Also suspect were two common approaches to healthy eating--low fat and vegetarianism--since humans have been eating animals for millions of years.<br><br>As for exercise, other animals don't "exercise" so much as they either play or just do what is required to survive. Birds fly. Fish swim. Humans are well adapted to moving in our own natural ways: ranging across the savannah, hunting, gathering, fighting, and procreating.<br><br>Modern humans are more sedentary than ever, and the evolutionary perspective agreed with the modern conventional wisdom. Want to be healthier? Move more. Yet many people exercise in highly routinized and monotonous ways, like running on a treadmill in a gym. They focus on abstract goals, like burning calories, and lose sight of functional, goal-oriented movements such as sprinting away from a threat or carrying an animal carcass back to camp. At a minimum, the evolutionary approach implied injecting variety into the types of movements and intensity level; hunter-gatherers did not do the elliptical for thirty minutes a day, four days a week. But there were limits to this line of thinking. The hunter-gatherer's source of motivation was running from a lion; the closest modern analogue is chasing down a cab--and no matter what we tell ourselves, there's hardly the same sense of urgency.<br><br>There were specifics to fill in, but the general evolutionary approach was sound. It was the appropriate starting point for any intelligent discussion on how to be healthy--even if it wasn't the last word.<br><br>Theories are nice, but would it work? Things were going to get real Darwinian real fast.<br><br>I started eating paleo in September of 2006.*<br><br>I stopped eating industrial foods: no ketchup, mac and cheese, mozzarella sticks, or sweets. I stopped eating grain products like wheat, corn, and rice; legumes like soy, peanuts, and beans; and dairy. I also eliminated starchy foods like potatoes (though I would come to learn that roots and tubers are a staple in many hunter-gatherer diets, both Paleolithic and contemporary).<br><br>Surprisingly (to me), there was still a wide range of foods available to eat. My status as an "omnivore" was not in question. I ate meat, seafood, fresh vegetables, and a modest amount of fruit, nuts, seeds, and eggs--basically any category of food that seemed like it would have been available in the wild that also happened to be available in my local grocery store (except for my prejudice against potatoes).<br><br>I moved away from "three square meals a day" and interjected a little variation into my eating routines. I even fasted once a week for the first three months, skipping dinner and going roughly eighteen hours from lunch to the following breakfast.<br><br>I never counted calories or measured macronutrients (fat, protein, and carbs). Relative to what is considered "normal," I ended up with a high-fat, moderate protein, low-carbohydrate diet.<br><br>I found it hard to give up alcohol entirely, but I completely cut out sweet mixers and cut back on beer, which is grain-based. I reduced my coffee intake to about a cup a day, only in the morning.<br><br>I did my best to get at least seven hours of sleep at night, and I got more sunshine during the day.<br><br>After about ten days of eating paleo, I knew I had something. My "diet" was working.<br><br>* My current diet has "evolved" from my initial experiment at eating paleo. A longer discourse on food can be found in Chapters 7 and 8, and a summary is located in Recommendations.</p><h2>To Believe in God</h2><p>Dust jacket notes: &#34;To believe in God is an irresistible invitation to a joyous participation in life. Too often religious statements impart an atmosphere of solemnity and gloom, when they should communicate only gladness. Joseph Pintauro, poet, and Sister Corita, artist, alert us to the excitement of believing in God. Joseph Pintauro&#39;s poetry makes celebration of life an integral part of faith. His brief creations are often playful and childlike, and translate belief in God into new humanist forms. Sister Corita&#39;s art is a happening.

In Pure Ketchup, Andrew F. Smith chronicles American milestones in ketchup history, including colonial adaptations of popular British mushrooms, anchovy, and walnut ketchups, the rise of tomato-based ketchup, the proliferation of commercial bottling after the Civil War, debates over preservatives, the resurgence of homemade and designer varieties, and a recent challenge from salsa. He also includes 110 historical recipes.</p><p>The marriage of food and pop culture has one of its better moments in <b>Pure Ketchup </b> by Andrew F. Smith. This history proves that a book larded with hundreds of footnotes can captivate. Smith's writing is lucid and clips along briskly from one astonishing fact to the next. Did you know that ketchup was so much the rage by the early 19th century that Lord Byron, Jane Austin and Charles Dickens all mention it in their work? Or that in 1915 over 800 brands of ketchup were sold in the state of Connecticut alone? Smith elucidates the cloudy origins of both the word ("ketchup" "catchup" "catsup") and the condiment. He documents the evolution of its commercial production in America. Enormous demand for ketchup and other tomato products, he explains, fueled the movement to rid it of adulterants and preservatives and was key to passage of the Pure Food and Drugs Bill in 1906. The 50 recipes Smith includes are all historical.

Two U.S. Treasury agents, both partners and antagonists, are drawn into a matrix of violence and corruption, L.A. style, a journey through a sunlit hell. At the end, they become experts on the thin line which separates what it takes to live - and to die - in L.A.</p><p><b>Gerald Petievich</b> has made a career in criminal investigation. He served first as a Special Agent in the U.S. Army Intelligence Corps, and, as a Special Agent of the U.S. Secret Service of the Treasury Department, he spent some time in the Paris office where he worked with Interpol, chasing counterfeiters of U.S. currency all over Europe, Africa and the Middle East. <p>He comes from a family of cops - his father and brother are both officers in the Los Angeles Police Department, and he has been working as Secret Service Representative to the Los Angeles Federal Strike Force Against Organized Crime and Racketeering. </p><p>Gerald Petievich is as intensely committed to his job - and as free from illusions about it - as is his protagonist, Charles Carr.</p><p> </p><p>The authors' experiences intensify the reality of his numerous, and critically aclaimed works. His best selling novel, <b><i>To Live and Die in L.A.,</i></b> was made into a major motion picture.

Thoreau)</h2><p><p>Thoreau's <i>Walden</i>, ostensibly a simple account of a year spent alone in a cabin by a pond in the woods, is one of the most influential and complex books in American literature. After eight years in the writing,the first edition of 1854 was largely ignored, and it was not reprinted until 1862, the year of Thoreau's death. But by 1900 <i>Walden</i> was acclaimed by many as a classic, among the finest prose works of the century. It has been increasingly recognized as an important document of social criticism and dissent. It has been seen as a religious testament, with a kinship to oriental mysticism. It has been described as a mythic book,and it has been used as a Freudian key to the mind of its iconoclastic author. Thoreau's words have become increasingly significant in modern times. Anticipating the evils of modern society and the problems of modern man, <i>Walden</i>'s meanings seem more relevant every day.</p></p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.In 1845 Henry David Thoreau left his pencil-manufacturing business and began building a cabin on the shore of Walden Pond near Concord, Massachusetts. This lyrical yet practical-minded book is at once a record of the 26 months Thoreau spent in withdrawal from society -- an account of the daily minutiae of building, planting, hunting, cooking, and, always, observing nature -- and a declaration of independence from the oppressive mores of the world he left behind. Elegant, witty, and quietly searching, Walden remains the most persuasive American argument for simplicity of life clarity of conscience.<br><br>For the first time, the authoritative editions of works by major American novelists, poets, scholars, and essayists collected in the hardcover volumes of The Library of America are being published singly in a series of handsome paperback books. A distinguished writer has contributed an introduction for each volume, which also includes a chronology of the author's life and career, an essay on the text, and notes.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Saint Francis and the Wolf</h2><p><p>Terrible wolf is terrorizing the town of Gubbia, and no one can stop him! First the townspeople send a brave knight. He never returns. Then they send an army of trained warriors. They get destroyed. Finally the townspeople send a great and mighty war machine, but even that can't stop the wolf. The villagers don't know what to do -- until Saint Francis visits the town and speaks to the wolf in his own language.</p><p>Caldecott Medal -- winning artist Richard Egielski exquisitely illustrates this classic tale of love, friendship, and the importance of living together in harmony.</p></p><p><p>Richard Egielski is the Caldecott Medal-winning illustrator of <em>Hey, Al</em> and many other books for children, including the Tub People series by Pam Conrad.

Mr. Egielski lives in Milford, New Jersey, with his wife and son.</p>*Starred Review* PreS-Gr. 2. Children are easily drawn to stories about St. Francis and his powerful, easy ability to connect with the Earth's creatures, and Egielski's retelling of a famous St. Francis legend, the wolf of Grubbio, is an entertaining, pitch-perfect gem. The first line--"A long time ago, in Italy, when knights battled and kings and queens lived in grand castles"--sets a fairy-tale tone, which fits the story beautifully. There isn't an off step in the brief, descriptive text; the succinct, winsome passages are perfectly paced for read-alouds, and they nimbly share the storytelling with Egielski's detailed illustrations. Printed on speckled paper resembling parchment scrolls and bordered with details from Italian art history, the rich artwork extends the words' fine balance between earnest, fantasy conventions and gleeful humor in scenes filled with grand architecture and costumes and wholly expressive characters. Frequent, wordless spreads show the wolf, more schoolyard bully than terrifying beast, easily dispatching knights and soldiers (he's shown lounging in his armor-strewn lair, picking his teeth with a knight's spear), before St. Francis tames him "with love," and the town lives peacefully ever after. For more about St. Francis for the age group, suggest Robert Kennedy Jr.'s <i>Saint Francis of Assisi</i> (2005) and Margaret Hodges' <i>Brother Francis and the Friendly Beasts</i> (1991). <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

A dismembered body has been found in the river, and it&#x2019;s up to Trotti to figure out who the murder victim is. At the same time, an estranged friend approaches Trotti with a desperate personal plea: his six-year-old daughter&#x2014;Trotti&#x2019;s own goddaughter&#x2014;has been kidnapped. In the wake of the high-profile kidnapping of Aldo Moro, president of Italy&#x2019;s majority party, faith in law enforcement is at an all-time low, and it&#x2019;s no surprise the distraught father isn&#x2019;t willing to take this matter to the police.</p><p>CWA award-winning author Timothy Williams has written six crime novels set in Italy featuring Commissario Piero Trotti as well as two novels set in the French Caribbean, <i>Another Sun</i> and <i>The Honest Folk of Guadeloupe</i>. Born in London and educated at St. Andrews, Williams has taught at the universities of Poitiers in France, Bari and Pavia in Italy, at Jassy in Romania, and most recently in the French West Indies. <i>The Observer</i> placed him among the ten best modern European crime novelists.<b>Chapter 1</b><br> &nbsp;<br><br>Trotti sat at his desk and for a moment stared out of the window.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sky was dark with future rain and the tiles of the neighboring rooftops had lost their terracotta glow. A swallow dropped through the air. The cooing of the pigeons had ceased.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He felt depressed, slightly sick. After a week of hot summer days&#x2014;and this at the end of April&#x2014;dark cloudbanks had formed to the north and had come up over the Alps, bringing a chill air. His ankles were cold in the short white socks. At the same time, he felt sticky and uncomfortable.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Magagna!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brigadiere Magagna stuck his head through the door. &#x201c;Dottore?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Bring me a coffee. And one for yourself.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The door closed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked again at the photographs on his desk: a dead piece of flesh. Without meaning, without purpose, photographed in a glossy black and white.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trotti had seen his first corpse when he was seventeen years old. A couple of partisans, not much older than himself, in shabby clothes, the red scarf still around their necks, had been strung up by the repubblichini and left to bleed to death. At the time he had wondered what had become of the amputated hands. The smell, the dark blood on the cobblestones and the flies&#x2014;they had been part of his nightmares ever since.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Magagna knocked and entered carrying a small tray; the air of the dingy office filled with the reassuring aroma of coffee.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Grappa?&#x201d; Trotti took the bottle from the cupboard of the desk and without waiting for a reply, poured a shot into each cup. Small, plastic cups with vacuum filled walls and screw-on caps.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They drank.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Vespa went past in the narrow street below; the engine sounded hollow and angry beneath the old brick walls of the Questura. Several birds darted upwards, touched at the gutter of the roof opposite and then flew away.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Magagna drank noisily, the froth of the coffee tinting the ends of his moustache. &#x201c;Good.&#x201d; He always said that. He placed the cup back on the tray. &#x201c;Thank you, Commissario.&#x201d; He wiped his moustache with the back of his hand.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Sit down, Magagna. I want to speak to you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Magagna took the green canvas armchair; the cloth was worn and in need of sewing. He was a good-looking man, with a broad forehead and dark black hair. From Pescara. He had the healthy complexion of a peasant. Wide shoulders filled the uniform shirt, neatly washed and creased. A pair of American sunglasses; the thin arms ran parallel to the line demarking his hair and his well shaven cheeks. He smiled readily, showing even teeth.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;d be grateful if you dealt with this matter.&#x201d; He pushed the photograph across the desk. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m busy at the moment. It&#x2019;s nearly seven weeks since they kidnapped the most important man in Italian politics and nobody is any closer to catching the criminals. Or saving Moro&#x2019;s life. It&#x2019;s nothing to do with us here but Leonardelli seems to think differently. And in ten days&#x2019; time, we&#x2019;ve got the municipal elections.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trotti laughed without humor. &#x201c;Leonardelli could put us all on traffic duty and say it was a national emergency. &#x2018;In this moment of crisis and political tension, the state knows that it can count upon the loyalty of all the forces of order and in particular upon the Pubblica Sicurezza, who acting upon the instructions of a democratically elected government . . .&#x2019;&#x201d; Trotti had raised his hands; he now let them drop back on the desk. &nbsp;There was a packet of sweets by the telephone. He unwrapped one&#x2014;rhubarb flavor&#x2014;and placed it in his mouth. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a politician.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What do you want me to do, Dottore?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Everything. Get a report from Medicina Legale. It looks like a woman. Put out a check on lost persons. Try the Carabinieri and the Pubblica Sicurezza of the up-river urban centers. And try Milan. See if you can . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Commissario!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a hatch door in the wall; from the other side Gino was banging against the thin panels. &#x201c;Line three, Commissario, for you. It&#x2019;s a private call.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Excuse me.&#x201d; Trotti leaned forward and picked up the phone.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Pronto.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was not Agnese. The voice was male and hoarse. &#x201c;Commissario Trotti?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Speaking.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a pause. The faint bell of a cash register tinkled; muted voices speaking in the background.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;This is Commissario Trotti speaking.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I must speak with you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You are speaking with me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;In private.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Who is that, please?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The deadened scraping of fingers against the plastic mouthpiece. &#x201c;I am a friend, Commissario. You know me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I am here in my office. The Questura, third floor. I shall be here for another couple of hours. You can speak with me here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A click of exasperation; air being sucked in. The voice was now louder, a hint of anger. &#x201c;That is not possible. I must see you alone. You understand&#x2014;away from your office.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I am a busy man.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You have a daughter, Commissario.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first fat drops of rain fell with sudden ease onto the sill of the window; dark blotches multiplied like the plague on the concrete ledge. Magagna stood up to close the windows; he stepped over a pile of beige dossiers.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I imagine you care for your daughter.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Pioppi?&#x201d; Trotti&#x2019;s knuckles had whitened. &#x201c;Where is she?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I must see you. Now.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Where is Pioppi?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;In fifteen minutes; by the old stables near the river.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Where is she?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Come alone.&#x201d; The man hesitated. &#x201c;Please.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then with a click, the line went dead.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 2</b><br> &nbsp;<br> They took the Alfetta and raced through the city center. The streets were empty of traffic. A few pedestrians hidden beneath dark umbrellas hurried along the pavements.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the edge of the town they joined up with the flow of traffic, cut across Viale Gorizia&#x2014;Magagna had turned on the siren&#x2014;went across the iron bridge and followed the dark line of the canal to where the water gushed over the lock into the river.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They came to a halt by the rusting dredgers. &#x201c;Wait here and turn that damn thing off.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trotti got out, opened his umbrella and buttoned his jacket. The pistol weighed at his pocket. He walked fast, shoes splashing on the wet road. The wail of the siren slowly died in the damp air.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was the edge of the city where the old houses gradually fell away and where the road became a cart track, running parallel to the river&#x2014;a no-man&#x2019;s land inhabited by a thin phalanx of plane trees. To Trotti&#x2019;s left, one or two flat farmhouses, red brick with sloping, tiled roofs&#x2014;a few uninhabited. Beyond them, the low-lying allotments, then the textile factory, its chimneys and its satellite apartment blocks, tawdry beneath the grey rain.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On his right, the Po.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rain was coming down hard, thundering against the taut black nylon of the umbrella. He slipped on the wet mud and swore. An ugly place, part of the city and disowned by it. The rain could not hide the sharp, unpleasant smell of acid that came from the factory chimneys. People had been complaining about it for years. Nothing had been done; the company could not afford the cost of a filter. When the complaints grew too strident, the director threatened closure and the loss of jobs. For a time, the complaints ceased.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An ugly place; twice a year the river broke its banks and swamped the saplings. Then in its retreat, the Po left dead wood and industrial detritus, plastic shopping bags and bleached cigarette packets. And a patina of mud that turned to powdery dust in the summer months.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He followed the track along the river; it curved and at the bend there was a wooden shack and two rusting caravans. Smoke poured from a perforated oil drum, billowing fumes of rubber. A dozen cars, piled up, stood like gaunt carcasses against the grey water of the river. Gypsies, vagrants, rag-and-bone men&#x2014;they lived here, earning a living from the scrap metal. Two mongrels bounded towards Trotti and yapped at his ankles.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stepped round an old juke-box, lying on its tarnished chrome in the mud. The dogs barked louder.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fat, blonde woman quickly disappeared through the door of one of the caravans. She was smoking.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The road curved away and the dogs lost interest in him and scampered off. Trotti was now hidden from the caravans by a row of bushes. He went up a slight slope where the ground was drier and he broke into a run. He tried not to think of Pioppi. He placed his hand against his pocket to stop the gun from slapping against his thigh.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rain pattered overhead onto the leaves of the trees. Trotti stopped when he saw the man; he was leaning against the corrugated wall of the stables.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirty meters between them. Trotti walked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two horses stood in an open field, staring at the rain with mournful eyes; they nuzzled at each other, as though looking for warmth. Painted wooden hurdles and white barriers lay scattered across the grass.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten, twelve years ago, it was here that Trotti used to bring Pioppi in her horse riding days; sometimes Agnese came too.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He gripped the Beretta in his pocket.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bales of hay had been piled beneath the sloping iron roof. The man moved away from the wall and came towards Trotti.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you could come.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the face was hidden by a woman&#x2019;s umbrella, there was something familiar in the way the man walked. The body leaned backwards and he set his weight heavily upon each leg in turn.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Trotti.&#x201d; The red umbrella went back, revealing the tired, pale face.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Ermagni.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He tried to smile. White, unhealthy skin, dark eyebrows and bleary, bloodshot eyes.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What are you doing here? Where&#x2019;s Pioppi?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. It was a silly idea.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Where is she?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ermagni shrugged. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. School, perhaps.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;She&#x2019;s not with you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Of course not&#x2014;but on the spur of the moment, I couldn&#x2019;t think of any other way to persuade . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trotti heaved a sigh of relief; the shirt on his back felt hot with sweat. He released the grip on the pistol and he noticed that the palm of his hand hurt.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, it&#x2019;s my fault.&#x201d; Ermagni came towards Trotti, the umbrella over his shoulder and holding out his large hand. Trotti struck him; the back of his hand against the stubble of the jaw. Ermagni stumbled backwards and fell into the mud. The red umbrella rolled away.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know what else to do.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I almost killed you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rain splattered the large face, forming more tears that ran over the fat cheeks and fell to the mud. &#x201c;I was beside myself. I didn&#x2019;t know what to do.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He rolled heavily over onto his hands and clambered upright. Trotti picked up the red umbrella. &#x201c;I had to talk to you. You&#x2019;ve always been good to me.&#x201d; He smelt of stale perspiration. He was wearing a jacket that was crumpled and now smeared with fresh mud. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re her godfather.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get out of the rain.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They stepped beneath the curving roof of the stable as one of the horses neighed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I wanted to go directly to the police but he wouldn&#x2019;t let me. He said that he wanted to keep things quiet&#x2014;for the time being at least&#x2014;in case they contacted us. In case there is a ransom to pay.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Who said this?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Said what?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Not to come to the police?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ermagni smiled vaguely. &#x201c;Rossi&#x2014;my father-in-law. If he knows that I&#x2019;m seeing you, he&#x2019;ll be furious. He hates the police&#x2014;and he doesn&#x2019;t want the bank account to be blocked. You see, that&#x2019;s why I had to speak to you in private.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trotti pulled the pistol from his pocket. &#x201c;You nearly got yourself killed.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With dull eyes, Ermagni glanced at the pistol, heedless&#x2014;or perhaps unaware&#x2014;of its menace.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Five minutes.&#x201d; He held up five stubby fingers. &#x201c;Five minutes of your time, that&#x2019;s all I ask. Please, Commissario. You&#x2019;re her godfather. I wouldn&#x2019;t ask you unless . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another tear swelled at the corner of his red eyelids. Ermagni turned away and gulped like a man in need of breath. Above them, the rain battered against the iron roof. A puddle had formed in an old tire-track. The two horses stood motionless in the open field.</p><h2>No Greater Glory: The Four Immortal Chaplains and the Sinking of the Dorchester in World War II</h2><p>The sinking of the <i>Dorchester</i> in the icy waters off Greenland shortly after midnight on February 3, 1942, was one of the worst sea disasters of World War II. It was also the occasion of an astounding feat of heroism&#x2014;and faith.<br><br>As water gushed through a hole made by a German torpedo, four chaplains&#x2014;members of different faiths but linked by bonds of friendship and devotion&#x2014;moved quietly among the men onboard. Preaching bravery, the chaplains distributed life jackets, including their own. In the end, these four men went down with the ship, their arms linked in spiritual solidarity, their voices raised in prayer. In this spellbinding narrative, award-winning author and journalist Dan Kurzman tells the story of these heroes and the faith&#x2014;in God and in country&#x2014;that they shared. <br><br>They were about as different as four American clergymen could be. George Lansing Fox (Methodist), wounded and decorated in World War I, loved his family and his Vermont congregation&#x2014;yet he re-enlisted as soon as he heard about Pearl Harbor. Rabbi Alex Goode was an athlete, an intellectual, and an adoring new father&#x2014;yet he too knew, the day Pearl Harbor was bombed, that he would serve. Clark Poling (Dutch Reformed), the son a famous radio evangelist, left for war begging his father to pray that he would never be a coward. Father John Washington (Catholic), a scrappy Irish street fighter, had dedicated himself to the church after a childhood brush with death. Chance brought the chaplains together at a Massachusetts training camp, but each was convinced that God had a reason for placing them together aboard the <i>Dorchester</i>.<br><br>Drawing on extensive interviews with the chaplains&#x2019; families and the crews of both the <i>Dorchester</i> and the German submarine that fired the fatal torpedo, Kurzman re-creates the intimate circumstances and great historic events that culminated in that terrible night. The final hours unfold with the electrifying clarity of nightmare&#x2014;the chaplains taking charge of the dwindling supply of life jackets, the panic of the crew, the overcrowded lifeboats, the prayers that ring out over the chaos, and the tight circle that the four chaplains form as the inevitable draws near.<br><br>In <b>No Greater Glory</b><i>,</i> Dan Kurzman tells how four extraordinary men left their mark on a single night of war&#x2014;and forever changed the lives of those they saved. Riveting and inspiring, this is a true story of heroism, of goodness in the face of disaster, and of faith that transfigures even the horror of war.</p><p><b>DAN KURZMAN</b>, a former foreign correspondent for <i>The Washington Post</i>, is the author of fifteen previous books and the winner of five major literary and journalistic awards.

Wake up!&#x201d;<br><br>First Sergeant Michael Warish did not respond to the pleas of the shadowy figure hovering over his ravaged body, which, shortly before dawn on February 4, 1943, lay crumpled on a stretcher spread on the snow-blanketed dock in Narsarssuak, a port town near the southern tip of Greenland. He had just been carried from the Coast Guard cutter Comanche, together with scores of other wounded and dying men who were awaiting an ambulance from a nearby hospital.<br><br>They had been pulled out of the freezing waters of the North Atlantic about one hundred miles south of Greenland after a German U-boat torpedoed the USAT Dorchester, a troop carrier crammed with nine hundred men, most of whom died aboard the ship when it went down or froze to death in the icy currents. The sinking was one of the worst sea disasters in World War II.<br><br>Finally, the figure crouching over Michael shook him by the shoulders and saw his eyelids flutter, then open slightly. Michael glimpsed the dark form of someone etched against the slightly lighter sky.<br><br>&#x201c;Where am I?&#x201d; he muttered.<br><br>&#x201c;Greenland,&#x201d; replied the fuzzy image. &#x201c;How ya doin&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br><br>Michael didn&#x2019;t recognize the commander of the United States Army unit he was returning to after a leave at home. Greenland? Was that another name for heaven? Was he alive? Michael wasn&#x2019;t sure. He couldn&#x2019;t even remember his name, who he was. But he vaguely recalled stepping off the sinking ship into a black, foaming, ice-strewn infinity. Then the agonized cry that had resonated in the night and lingered in the frosty air, a cry that now echoed mercilessly in his mind: &#x201c;Mother! Mother! Please save me!&#x201d;<br><br>And gradually all those hundreds of little red lights that had speckled the ocean began flickering again. Almost like Christmas, he thought. Except that these lights reflected not a merry affirmation of life but a cynical celebration of death. Attached to life jackets so that the glitter could attract rescuers, they marked the graves of men like himself who were either dead or dying. No one, he had heard, could live more than twenty minutes in freezing water, and there was no time, he was sure, for rescue ships to come.<br><br>As Michael bounced in his life jacket from wave to wave, he resigned himself to death and suddenly, to his surprise, felt relaxed. He thought about his mother and his deceased sister, whom he would soon join, and about his fourth-grade teacher, who had given him a cookie every day. Yes, he was dying, but he could feel nothing&#x2014;other than the burning in his throat from the salt and oil he swallowed as he drifted through the slick polluting the sea around the stricken ship. His body, nearly frozen, was numb. He simply felt sleepy, but once he fell asleep, he knew, he would not wake. Actually, an easy way to die.<br><br>Yet instinct forced him to refrain from shutting his eyes as long as possible, at least until the full twenty minutes medically allotted to life in the icy ocean was up. . . . What happened after that? He didn&#x2019;t remember. He must have died . . . and so, it seemed, he was in heaven . . .<br><br>Some hours later, Michael, conscious but with his mind still muddled, was carried along with other survivors to an ambulance that sped to a nearby barracks serving as a hospital, where doctors put him to bed and treated his leg, head, and back wounds. Soon, he drifted again into a deep sleep, though this time he would wake in the morning without prodding. He could remember his name now, and he realized that Greenland, where he was based, was not heaven.<br><br>Though the numbness was partially gone and the pain from his wounds was intensifying, Michael got up, deeply depressed, and, ignoring the advice of his doctors, hobbled to the barracks housing his unit a few hundred yards away to see his old comrades. Perhaps they could help rid him of his depression and put the horrors he had endured behind him.<br><br>But the reunion didn&#x2019;t work. His friends greeted him with joy, but also with endless questions about the disaster. In desperation, Michael locked himself in the barracks boiler room and sat on a stool. He wanted to ease his pain in the warmth&#x2014;and to be alone; to drain his soul of the torment inflicted by fragmented memory, to still the echo of that maddening cry for help. But he knew this was impossible without first unblocking all the horrific details festering in the inner recesses of his mind.<br><br>Gradually, Michael relived the catastrophe. He could see himself getting wounded in the explosion, trapped in his quarters, then escaping and crawling to the deck, where, as the ship was going down, he witnessed a scene of an almost biblical nature. He had never been religious, but he felt strangely exalted now in the presence of four familiar figures in the tableau. Unable to imagine a more sacred moment, he began mumbling the half-forgotten words of the Lord&#x2019;s Prayer and, climbing over the railing of the swiftly sinking ship, stepped into the arctic sea.<br><br><b>2</b><br><br>Michael Warish had not been eager to leave home after his furlough and return to Greenland, with its icy weather, its bare, snow-covered fields, its overwhelming desolation and dreariness of life. But worst of all, as a North Atlantic veteran he knew the dangers lurking along the route to Greenland. German U-boats in so-called wolf packs infested the Strait of Belle Isle, aptly referred to as Torpedo Junction, between Labrador and Newfoundland Island. They had already sunk scores of Allied ships in these swirling waters.<br><br>Still, Michael, an eleven-year army enlistee who was now a member of an artillery company assigned to protect bases and construction crews in Greenland, was consoled by the thought that he would be rejoining his buddies, with whom he had tightly bonded in seeking to ease the bleakness of almost total isolation. Besides, he was scheduled to be back in the United States soon. He had first been sent to this vast arctic desert, the world&#x2019;s largest island, in 1941, and this was his sixth trip there. He had come home on furlough this time to attend his sister&#x2019;s funeral, and now, two weeks later, he was returning, one of the few passengers on the Dorchester who was sure where it was headed.<br><br>On the afternoon of January 22, 1943, Michael stepped off the train from Camp Miles Standish in Taunton, Massachusetts, with a &#x201c;casual,&#x201d; or temporary, company of about three hundred other men, mostly green recruits, and onto Pier 11 in Staten Island, New York. Some who had never sailed on a large ship before gaped at the sight of the Dorchester. Despite its rather shabby, gray exterior, it had the sleek and graceful lines of a luxury liner rather than the forbidding, fortlike appearance of a warship. The men were excited as they mounted the gangplank.<br><br>In fact, the Dorchester, 367 feet long and weighing a relatively light 5,680 tons, had been launched in 1926 as a luxury passenger ship by the Merchant and Miners Transportation Company of Baltimore, Maryland. It could provide 314 vacationers with comfortable cabins, suites, and public rooms that advertisements claimed matched the magnificence of the &#x201c;finest hotel.&#x201d; It was alive every night with laughter, bright lights, and soothing dance music.<br><br>Also aboard was a large, dazzling casino, where patrons could gamble as the ship cruised up the East Coast from Florida to New York, with stops in between at various ports. But in March 1942, with the war under way, the vessel metamorphosed into a troop carrier and the slot machines gave way to cannons. German U-boats were sinking ship after Allied ship, and the United States, caught unprepared for a full-scale sea war, had to bring every available vessel into service, no matter how old or dilapidated.<br><br>Soon bases were sprouting in the white, windy, arctic wilderness of Greenland as American engineers and military personnel poured in&#x2014;those who were lucky enough to survive the U-boat attacks on troop transports taking them there. One Dorchester crew member, Chester J. Szymczak, who had sailed several times on the ship, later said:<br><br>&#x201c;Breaking down in the middle of the North Atlantic, or being lost for days in the fog, seeing a ship disappear from a convoy, was noth- ing new for the Dorchester. If the ship made a trip without a mishap, it was considered lucky. There were many reports that the Dorchester was sunk.&#x201d;<br><br>In fact, one of the Dorchester&#x2019;s two sister ships, the Chatham, was the first American troopship sunk in the war. After two uneventful round-trips to Newfoundland and Greenland from New York and Boston, its luck ran out. On August 27, 1942, the USAT Chatham was torpedoed and sent to the bottom of the Strait of Belle Isle. Fortunately, escorts were able to save all but twenty-six of the 569 people aboard. Would the Dorchester&#x2019;s luck run out, too, perhaps with much deadlier results?<br><br>Anyway, many soldiers saw before them a ship whose weather-stained exterior still offered the impression of a luxury liner, if a rather decrepit one, and some felt they might be embarking on a more pleasant cruise than they had anticipated. And they wouldn&#x2019;t need a casino to carry on their crap games.<br><br>As James McAtamney, one of the soldiers, said of this first impression, &#x201c;All the kids, at least of my generation, had the same idea: One of these days I&#x2019;m gonna make enough money to take one of those luxury trans-Atlantic cruises. In those days it was the Queen Mary or the Mauritania, et cetera.&#x201d;<br><br>Still, stevedores and others on the dock warned, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be sorry, you&#x2019;ll be sorry,&#x201d; and one soldier, an undertaker from Long Island&#x2014; perhaps influenced by the end product of his civilian occupation&#x2014; ominously predicted, &#x201c;This damn thing is never gonna make it!&#x201d; Indeed, some who had earlier sailed on the Dorchester called it &#x201c;the sui...</p><h2>Men of Steel: The Story of the Family That Built the World Trade Center</h2><p><i>I knew almost immediately why the towers collapsed the way they did. And I sat there and cried. I wept for the thousands I knew must have died. And I wept because we built the damn things.<br></i><br>Like millions of people around the world, Karl Koch III watched in disbelief as the World Trade Center collapsed right before his eyes on the morning of September 11, 2001. But the sadness that tormented him in the days and weeks that followed was fueled not only by the compassion and anger that most of us felt but also by his intimate connection with every beam and column in the Twin Towers. <br><br>In 1966, the Karl Koch Erecting Company, founded by the author&#x2019;s grandfather and father in the 1920s, had been awarded the contract to erect the 200,000 tons of steel and more than 6 million square feet of floor that would turn a grand idea more than a decade in the making into the world&#x2019;s two tallest buildings. It would be the crowning achievement for a proud family enterprise that had built many of America&#x2019;s most important buildings, from Washington landmarks such as the U.S. Supreme Court and the Library of Congress buildings to such fabled New York hotels as the Pierre and the New Yorker to the half-mile-long, 42-acre plant in Oak Ridge, <br>Tennessee, that was the birthplace of the hydrogen bomb. But none of those projects could prepare this company of fathers and sons and brothers and uncles for the challenges confronting them on erecting the Twin Towers. <br><br>In <b>Men of Steel</b>, Koch and award-winning author Richard Firstman tell the complete and fascinating story of the creation of the World Trade Center: the politics behind its conception, the innovative thinking that went into its design, the drama of its construction, and the truth behind its destruction. But the story of the Twin Towers is the climax to a saga that starts a century earlier, when the author&#x2019;s grandfather, the son of a German immigrant, drove his first rivets by hand into our nation&#x2019;s earliest steel structures. It brings to life the rough-and-tumble iron working culture, a world where men with names like Toots Garrity and Hole in the Head Himpler climbed hundreds of feet into the air, erecting steel with great pride despite the very real threat of death and injury they faced every day. <br><br><b>Men of Steel</b> is a brilliant evocation of a family dynasty inextricably intertwined with the steel that makes up many of our nation&#x2019;s most prominent landmarks. In the tradition of David McCullough&#x2019;s <b>The Great Bridge</b>, this rich, multilayered narrative exposes the heart and soul that goes into making these remarkable structures. And, most poignantly, in recounting the making and unmaking of the World Trade Center, <b>Men of Steel</b> is at once a lament and a tribute, both to the illustrious buildings and to the country whose strength they symbolized.</p><p>&#x201c;Building the [World Trade Center] was a project that pushed the limits of human endurance and engineering know-how.

I was working as Special Assistant to Robert McNamara. My office at the Pentagon was directly across the hall from his. That morning The Washington Post and New York Times were on my desk, their headlines proclaiming Lyndon Johnson&#x2019;s landslide over Barry Goldwater, 61 to 39 percent.<br> <br>McGeorge Bundy, the President&#x2019;s National Security Adviser, rasped cheerily over the phone: &#x201c;Califano! Can you get over here and meet with Bill Moyers [a Special Assistant to the President] and me at eleven o&#x2019;clock?&#x201d;1<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;About what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We want to talk to you about joining the White House staff.&#x201d;<br> <br>Moyers and Bundy were waiting in Moyers&#x2019;s office. They said the President (whose only previous contact with me was a handshake in August 1964)2 wanted me to take on two tasks: administration headhunter and White House expert on Latin American affairs. Moyers said my experience with McNamara gave me good lines to top talent, and Bundy thought work I had done on Cuba, Panama, and the Dominican Republic gave me a grounding in Latin America. I told them I would have to talk to McNamara. They urged me to wait until the President had spoken to him. I said I couldn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>As soon as I returned to the Pentagon, I joined McNamara at lunch.3 His response was almost brusque. &#x201c;Out of the question. First, they should never have talked to you without talking to me. Second, the work you&#x2019;re doing here is far more important. There are only two jobs over there that would be more important: Bundy&#x2019;s and Moyers&#x2019;s. Moyers&#x2019;s job only if the President made it a domestic adviser, in charge of the legislative program, coordinating economic policy and domestic matters generally. Forget about it. I&#x2019;ll talk to the President.&#x201d;<br> <br>Less than a week later, returning from a meeting at the LBJ Ranch in Texas,4 McNamara told me I would not be going to the White House. &#x201c;At least for now,&#x201d; he added. &#x201c;But I fear we&#x2019;ve whetted the President&#x2019;s appetite. So you may just have a six-month reprieve.&#x201d;<br> <br>The second call came eight months later, on July 8, 1965, from Jack Valenti, another of the President&#x2019;s special assistants. &#x201c;The President wants you on his staff,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;George Reedy [the presidential press secretary] is resigning today. Moyers is replacing him. The President wants you to pick up his old job.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to talk to McNamara,&#x201d; I responded, excited but nervous and unsure about my boss&#x2019;s reaction.<br> <br>&#x201c;The President already has,&#x201d; Valenti chortled. &#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t make the same mistake twice. Get on over here.&#x201d;<br> <br>At the White House Moyers and Valenti said that my new job would be to prepare legislative programs, manage domestic crises, and act as a general-utility infielder on the domestic scene.<br> <br>When I got back to the Pentagon, McNamara told me to come right to his office.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s also important that you work on matters relating to the economy,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The economic problems are bound to be severe as Great Society programs need more and more funds, since the cost of the war in Vietnam is likely to rise.&#x201d;<br> <br>An hour later, McNamara called me in to tell me that he had convinced the President he should let me coordinate economic policy.<br> <br>&#x201c;What a job!&#x201d; I gasped.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a job. With this President, it&#x2019;s not even a job description. It&#x2019;s an opportunity. You&#x2019;ll have to prove yourself to him to turn it into a job,&#x201d; McNamara said.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you want me to do?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Take it. He needs someone to pull the domestic side together. It won&#x2019;t be easy. I assure you of this: you will never work for a more complicated man as long as you live. But you&#x2019;re also not likely to work for a more intelligent one. Anyway, you&#x2019;ve been in the Defense Department four years. The change will be good for you. No one should stay in a job for more than four or five years.&#x201d;<br> <br>Late that afternoon, Moyers called to say the President wanted me at the White House mess for dinner. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s having a small dinner for the chairmen of the 1964 Great Society task forces and he wants you to have an opportunity to meet them.&#x201d;<br> <br>I said I was planning to have dinner with a friend from Panama who was already on his way to the restaurant. I thought I&#x2019;d best skip the White House dinner. Moyers understood.<br> <br>Five minutes later, he called again. &#x201c;The President told me to send a car out for your friend and take him home and for you to come here, period.&#x201d;<br> <br>So went my first lesson: this President did not like people to say no to him.<br> <br>At dinner,5 Johnson listened intently as each academic spent a few minutes outlining the most serious problems and opportunities facing America and the President. Remarkably, at least in retrospect, the Vietnam War was scarcely mentioned. Everyone was confident we could solve our domestic problems. In only nineteen months after assuming the presidency, Johnson had made enormous progress on the Democratic party&#x2019;s progressive agenda.<br> <br>The President, with whom I had not yet spoken, introduced me as a member of his staff. On my way out, he said he expected to see me at the LBJ Ranch for the weekend. As I drove home, I thought about my only direct experience of Lyndon Johnson in action.<br> <br>On October 14, 1964, it was reported that Walter Jenkins, a long-time Johnson aide (as close to a White House chief-of-staff as the President ever tolerated), had been arrested a week earlier for making advances to a sixty-one-year-old man at the downtown Washington YMCA. The story broke less than three weeks before the presidential election and promised to fuel Goldwater&#x2019;s charges of corruption and improprieties in Johnson&#x2019;s past.<br> <br>Around seven that evening, McNamara called me into his office. &#x201c;Walter Jenkins was a member of an Air Force Reserve unit on Capitol Hill,&#x201d; he said, speaking sharply. &#x201c;The President wants a copy of his Reserve personnel file immediately. Get it. Make damn sure that everything is Xeroxed and nothing is removed. Have one of your guys do the Xeroxing himself or watch it being done.&#x201d;<br> <br>I called Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, Lieutenant General William Stone. &#x201c;The Secretary of Defense wants a complete copy of Walter Jenkins&#x2019;s Air Force Reserve personnel record,&#x201d; I explained. &#x201c;This is so sensitive I&#x2019;m asking you to Xerox it yourself. One of my staff will come down immediately to help you. After it&#x2019;s copied, I suggest you keep the original in a safe in your own office.&#x201d;<br> <br>Two military officers on my staff were still around, Army Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Haig and an Air Force lieutenant colonel. Rather than put a young Air Force officer in the impossible position of standing over a general in his own service, I sent Al Haig to monitor the Xeroxing.<br> <br>As soon as we had a copy, McNamara and I rushed to Moyers&#x2019;s White House office. As Bundy, McNamara, and I gathered around a speaker phone, Moyers called Valenti at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City, where the President was speaking to the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Dinner. Lady Bird Johnson was preparing a sympathetic statement supporting Walter Jenkins and his family.6 When the President got on the phone, he expressed his suspicion that Jenkins had been framed or set up by the Republicans. He asked McNamara to read him texts of Jenkins&#x2019;s Air Force Reserve fitness reports signed by the commanding officer of the Capitol Hill Air Force Reserve unit. One was more glowing than the next.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; said the President, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d better call Walter&#x2019;s commanding officer. He&#x2019;ll be shaken by what&#x2019;s happened to Walter. And, in any case, I know he wouldn&#x2019;t want to embarrass himself by making any damned-fool statements.&#x201d;<br> <br>Moyers and Bundy smiled. McNamara and I exchanged glances. The commanding officer who had signed Jenkins&#x2019;s glowing reports was Air Force Reserve Major General Barry Goldwater.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>I got up at 3 A.M. on Saturday, July 10, 1965, to shower, pack, dress, and drive to Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington to catch a presidential Lear Jet. Valenti, his wife Mary Margaret, and speechwriter Richard Goodwin were also on board. We arrived at the ranch just after 9 A.M. Johnson met us at the airplane and sent us off to our rooms. Then Mrs. Johnson offered us scrambled eggs and spicy deer sausage. When I demurred, she said, &#x201c;I suggest you eat something now, young fellow. You never know with Lyndon what time the next meal will be.&#x201d; After breakfast we changed into bathing suits and joined the President at the pool, where he was swimming. His secretary, Victoria (Vicky) McCammon, sat on the side with her feet in the water.<br> <br>The pool, directly southeast of the ranch house, was surrounded by a red-brick border, a concrete sidewalk, and Bermuda grass. The President was still in the water when I dove in. He was talking about the Senate&#x2019;s passage of the bill to create Medicare the day before. From the shallow end of the pool he shouted to me, &#x201c;Are you ready to come help your President?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It would be an honor and a privilege,&#x201d; I called back.<br> <br>In the early afternoon, the President, with me next to him in the front seat, took his white Lincoln convertible, top down, for a drive around the ranch. Johnson had changed to dry trunks and a clean shirt, but I was still in my one pair of wet trunks and a knit shirt.<br> <br>It was incredibly hot; the dust clouds made it hard to breathe. But there was relief. As we drove around, we were followed by a car and a station wagon with Secret Service agents. The President drank Cutty Sark scotch and soda out of a large white plastic foam cup; I had a Coca-Cola. Periodically, Johnson would slow down, sometimes stop for a moment, and hold his left arm outside the car, shaking the cup and ice. A Secret Service agent would run up to the car, take the cup and go back to the station wagon. There another agent would refill it with ice, scotch, and soda as the first agent trotted behind the wagon. Then the first agent would run the refilled cup up to LBJ&#x2019;s outstretched arm and waiting hand, as the President&#x2019;s car moved slowly along.<br> <br>As he drove, the President would call his ranch foreman, Dale Malechek, on the car&#x2019;s Motorola radiophone.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dale, the Hereford in East Barley Field, I think it&#x2019;s number 481 [many Herefords were numbered on a horn], get on over and look at him. He doesn&#x2019;t seem to be eating properly and looks a little underweight.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Dale, on the feeding tree in the Fish Tank, get some more salt for the deer.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Dale. This Goddamn fence at Dales Trap needs to be fixed. Get it done in the morning.&#x201d;<br> <br>As we passed from one section of the ranch to another, Secret Servicemen would jump out of the car in front and rush to open gates so we could drive through without stopping.<br> <br>We stopped at LBJ&#x2019;s birthplace, a small two-room building with a tiny barn behind, drove back for a fast ride on the airstrip and again around the ranch, ending at the ranch house around 2 P.M. Shortly afterward, we boarded a helicopter for the Haywood Ranch, another of Johnson&#x2019;s properties, and Coca-Cola Cove at Lake LBJ, part of a chain of artificial lakes set in central Texas, thanks to the persistence of Congressman Lyndon B. Johnson. We lunched and spent the afternoon and early evening on a thirty-seven-foot yacht. From lake-front properties and in small motorboats, wire-service photographers constantly sought to take pictures. Secret Service agents in black speedboats tried to keep the photographers away. Johnson took care to drink out of an opaque plastic cup, usually below deck, whether it was filled with scotch or Fresca.<br> <br>We went ashore briefly at a house on the lake that the President called &#x201c;Jack and Mary Margaret&#x2019;s,&#x201d; after the Valentis. As we walked through the house, the President stopped in a bright shaft of sunlight in the living room. He unbuckled his belt and twisted toward his right side as he lowered his pants and pushed down his undershorts, trying to look at his increasingly bare right buttock.<br> <br>&#x201c;Something hurts back there,&#x201d; he said, now exploring the surface with his right hand. &#x201c;Is that a boil?&#x201d; he asked me as I stood to his right. Astonished, I looked&#x2014;&#x201c;peeked&#x201d; would be a better word&#x2014;and gulped, &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to get Dr. [presidential physician George] Burkley to look at it,&#x201d; the President said matter-of-factly as he tucked in his shirt, pulled up his pants, and buckled his belt.<br> <br>In the late afternoon, the President took me waterskiing. He drove his twenty-foot gold-colored speedboat up and down the lake and under a bridge with concrete supports about every ten yards. He drove faster and faster, zigging and zagging around the lake and between the concrete pillars. The faster he drove and twisted, the more I was determined to stay up. He threw me once. He was going so fast that I thought I&#x2019;d split apart when I flew off the skis and hit the water. Determined to prove myself, I got back up and managed not to fall off again.<br> <br>We returned to shore around 8 P.M. The President, with Vicky McCammon in the seat alongside him and me in the back, was now driving around in a small blue car with the top down. We reached a steep incline at the edge of the lake and the car started rolling rapidly toward the water. The President shouted, &#x201c;The brakes don&#x2019;t work! The brakes won&#x2019;t hold! We&#x2019;re going in! We&#x2019;re going under!&#x201d;<br> <br>The car splashed into the water. I started to get out. Just then the car leveled and I realized we were in an Amphicar. The President laughed. As we putted along the lake then (and throughout that evening), he teased me. &#x201c;Vicky, did you see what Joe did? He didn&#x2019;t give a damn about his President. He just wanted to save his own skin and get out of the car.&#x201d; Then he&#x2019;d roar.<br> <br>Around 9 P.M. we went to the Haywood ranch house for dinner. I was still in my wet bathing suit. The others, more experienced in LBJ&#x2019;s ways, had brought along a change of clothing. Near midnight we returned by chopper to the main ranch house, and the President asked me to come to his office. For half an hour, he handed me one paper after another, directing me to give them, along with his instructions, to various White House aides or cabinet members. When he finally retired, White House aide Jake Jacobsen gently took the papers from me and said he would carry out the President&#x2019;s instructions. I went to bed, almost twenty-four hours after I&#x2019;d gotten up in Washington.<br> <br>Life at the ranch would always be unpredictable. We never knew when we would work or play. In the pool, on the boat, during a meal, the President might give us an order to do something or to get an agency or department head to take some action. Breakfast was always early and on our own, but lunch could be anywhere from one to four o&#x2019;clock; it might be at the LBJ Ranch, on the boat, or at one of the Johnsons&#x2019; other ranches. The President usually took a nap, which could last anywhere from thirty minutes to a couple of hours. Dinner might be at eight or midnight and its location was just as uncertain. On Sundays we had no idea whether we would return that evening or Monday morning, afternoon, or evening, and we often departed on less than an hour&#x2019;s notice. Mrs. Johnson displayed ceaseless patience in accommodating her husband&#x2019;s spur-of-the-moment style.<br> <br>That first Sunday, Johnson and I attended separate services, he at the First Christian Church in Johnson City and I at St. Mary&#x2019;s Catholic Church in Fredericksburg. Back at the ranch, Johnson held a press conference to name Major Hugh Robinson as his new Army aide. I had interviewed several black Army officers for the job only a month before and had recommended Robinson.7 He became ...</p><h2>The Celtic Book of Days : A Guide to Celtic Spirituality &amp; Wisdom</h2><p>Glossy paperback.1996 128p. 8.25x9.00x0.40 IN CELTIC TRADITION, SPIRITUALITY IS WOVEN INTO THROUGH THE RHYTHMS OF DAILY LIFE.</p><p><br>Caitlin Matthews has written more than 21 books on spirituality, Celtic and Arthurian lore, and the Goddess, among them <em>Sophia, Goddess of Wisdom</em>; <em>Mabon and the Mysteries of Britain</em>; and <em>The Arthurian Tarot</em>.

The vampire hero of Anne Rice&#x2019;s enthralling novel is a creature of the darkest and richest imagination. Once an aristocrat in the heady days of pre-revolutionary France, now a rock star in the demonic, shimmering 1980s, he rushes through the centuries in search of others like him, seeking answers to the mystery of his eternal, terrifying existence. His is a mesmerizing story&#x2013;passionate, complex, and thrilling.</p><p>After the spectacular debut of <i>Interview with the Vampire</i> in 1976, Anne Rice put aside her vampires to explore other literary interests--Italian castrati in <i>Cry to Heaven</i> and the Free People of Color in <i>The Feast of All Saints</i>. But Lestat, the mischievous creator of Louis in <i>Interview</i>, finally emerged to tell his own story in the 1985 sequel, <i>The Vampire Lestat</i>.<p> As with the first book in the series, the novel begins with a frame narrative. After over a half century underground, Lestat awakens in the 1980s to the cacophony of electronic sounds and images that characterizes the MTV generation. Particularly, he is captivated by a fledgling rock band named Satan's Night Out. Determined both to achieve international fame and end the centuries of self-imposed vampire silence, Lestat takes command of the band (now renamed "The Vampire Lestat") and pens his own autobiography. The remainder of the novel purports to be that autobiography: the vampire traces his mortal youth as the son of a marquis in pre-Revolutionary France, his initiation into vampirism at the hands of Magnus, and his quest for the ultimate origins of his undead species.</p><p> While very different from the first novel in the Vampire Chronicles, <i>The Vampire Lestat</i> has proved to be the foundation for a broader range of narratives than is possible from Louis's brooding, passive perspective. The character of Lestat is one of Rice's most complex and popular literary alter egos, and his Faustian strivings have a mythopoeic resonance that links the novel to a grand tradition of spiritual and supernatural fiction. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p><b>Anne Rice</b> is the author of more than twenty-five bestselling books.

Is it possible to walk away from today&#x2019;s industrial, processed-food pipeline? Bestselling author Barbara Kingsolver and her family reveal that the answer to both questions is yes. They have chronicled a year in which they vowed to buy only locally produced food, grow it themselves or learn to live without it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With her illuminating prose, Kingsolver has created a compelling, wise and often humorous look at what it takes to reinvent a food culture that is healthy for the family, the neighbourhood and the planet. Part memoir, part journalistic investigation, part resource and entirely a great story, <em>Animal, Vegetable, Miracle</em> passionately urges us to take a second look at what we put on our tables and how it gets there.</p></p><p><p>Barbara Kingsolver is the author of nine bestselling works of fiction, including the novels, <em>Flight Behavior, The Lacuna, The Poisonwood Bible, Animal Dreams,</em> and <em>The Bean Trees</em>, as well as books of poetry, essays, and creative nonfiction. Her work of narrative nonfiction is the enormously influential bestseller <em>Animal, Vegetable, Miracle: A Year of Food Life</em>. Kingsolver&#x2019;s work has been translated into more than twenty languages and has earned literary awards and a devoted readership at home and abroad. She was awarded the National Humanities Medal, our country&#x2019;s highest honor for service through the arts, as well as the prestigious Dayton Literary Peace Prize for her body of work. She lives with her family on a farm in southern Appalachia.</p>Eaters must understand that how we eat determines how the world is used. They will with the help of this book from the Kingsolver-Hopp family. And why not make the narration of this book a family affair--since its a chronology of a year of conscious food choices involving abstinence from industrial food? The process includes vegetable growing and canning, cheese-making, poultry-raising and -slaughtering, and locovore shopping. Hopp, Kingsolvers husband, supplies scientific asides and practical suggestions on how to make better use of the world around us. Daughter Camille suggests recipes and meal plans. The book is so jam-packed with information that listeners will want to take notes. Theres a Web site, as well. And the farmyard sound effects are not to be missed. D.P.D.

Misunderstood for years, LaFontaine explains why caddis should be an important part of any fly-fisher's arsenal of flies, and his arguments are very persuasive. With in-depth and anecdote-punctuated discussions of the insect's biology and life cycle, tactics for deciding at what stage in the life cycle caddis are being fed upon (nymph, emerger, or dun), and various methods of presenting imitations, the author provides a thorough and scientific approach to catching fish. <i>Caddisflies</i> is analytical fly-fishing instruction at its best.Throughout fly-fishing history, says the author in his introduction to this important book, caddisflies have been treated as if they were less important than mayflies. They have been the drab sisters, disparaged or ignored, in the literature. On the stream they have been a puzzle that anglers have chosen to neglect...' But, as Caddisflies points out dramatically, this aquatic insect is of the highest importance to fly fishermen at various times - and the errors of the past have now been corrected. This book is a major study of this immensely important and often misunderstood trout-stream insect - and it was sorely needed. The book - which is the fruit of ten years of intensive study - introduces new, tested, and better patterns that impressionistically and effectively imitate the live insect. Then it presents detailed instructions on how best to fish larval, pupal, and adult flies - strategies, tactics, and proven techniques. There is careful study of the indicators that signal either emergence or egg-laying and there is instruction on the different ways fish feed on each stage. Finally, there is a truly comprehensive fly-fisherman's entomology - clear and thorough - of the important caddisfly species, with emergence tables and distribution charts for representative and major trout streams in various part of North America. Caddisflies thus fills a major gap in the fly-fishing literature. Its publication coincides with the great but scattered attention this insect has been receiving throughout the world - and the book promises to become the standard in its field and essential for all serious fly fishermen.

Special attention is given to the key mythic motifs that underlie sabbath observance: the sabbath as source of cosmic blessing; the sabbath as perfected time; the drama of divine restoration and sacred marriage; and the drama of human transformation by the sabbath as reflected in the motif of the sabbath-soul). This is followed by a theoretical discussion of the function and�&#x153;meaning of kabbalistic ritual and the problems of its interpretation. Theory gives way to practice with the close study of dramatic rituals located on the margins of the sabbath: the ritual of preparation - how one enters the sabbath - and the ritual of separation - how one leaves the sabbath and yet takes it into the week. Brief appendices deal with the special issues of Torah study and sexuality related to sabbath-observance. This now-classic study combines the close textual readings of traditional scholarly enquiry with more innovative approaches drawing on symbolic anthropology and the like. The presentation is coherent, cohesive, and accessible. It makes a contribution to the history of Jewish spirituality and, more broadly, to the understanding of myth and ritual.

But the response has been, and continues to<br>be, incredible. Even now, I employ a full-time assistant to<br>answer e-mails and letters from people writing to tell me of<br>their Jabez experiences! And the stories continue to flood in<br>from those who have tasted the miracle of answered prayer.<br><br>Wherever I go, wherever I teach, the question is always<br>the same: &#x201c;How can you explain the sales of your book?&#x201d; After<br>a couple of years, I felt that the answer had become apparent;<br>after all, nearly everywhere I went, someone rushed up to<br>share their own story: &#x201c;You should hear what God did when I<br>prayed the prayer of Jabez...&#x201d;<br><br>I remember speaking at the Billy Graham Cove where an<br>informal poll revealed that more than 80 percent of the<br>audience had purchased multiple copies to give as gifts to<br>their family and friends. One man had given away more than<br>eighty cases! Why? He told me, &#x201c;For some reason, God is<br>answering this prayer in the life of everyone I have given it<br>to&#x2014;and I want everyone I know to experience the reality<br>that God answers prayer!&#x201d;<br><br>The phrase &#x201c;You should hear what God did&#x201d; may be the<br>key to the unprecedented success of The Prayer of Jabez.<br>Millions of people have told millions of others what God has<br>done in their lives in answer to this simple prayer. And when<br>one person tells another what God has done, that&#x2019;s giving<br>God the credit He so richly deserves.<br><br><i>Jabez in Africa</i><br>I&#x2019;m also convinced that the prayer of Jabez is directly linked<br>to the call to launch a global movement called Dream for<br>Africa. After the success of the book and its follow-up, Secrets<br>of the Vine, our family unexpectedly felt called to move to<br>Africa and help with efforts to stop the AIDS epidemic,<br>perhaps the greatest crisis to hit mankind since the great<br>Flood. When the call came, I inquired of the Lord, &#x201c;Are you<br>sure? After all, I&#x2019;m not in my twenties anymore. Or my<br>thirties. Or my forties.&#x201d;<br><br>I had to smile from the gentle nudge that came back: But<br>aren&#x2019;t you the Jabez guy? Haven&#x2019;t you been pleading with Me for decades for<br>much, much more territory? Are we going to debate where the boundaries<br>of that territory lie?<br><br>During this season, I returned to Matthew 28:18&#x2013;20 and<br>meditated on the Great Commission for months, asking the<br>Lord to reveal to me if I had missed anything vital to the next<br>chapter in my service for Him. I discovered in that study<br>something very significant&#x2014;something that I knew, yet<br>didn&#x2019;t know&#x2014;that would change my life forever.<br><br>Jesus commanded His followers to disciple all &#x201c;nations,&#x201d;<br>or people groups. Not just individuals or families or cities, but<br>nations. For the first time in my ministry, I asked a totally<br>different question: &#x201c;How can I obey the Great Commission<br>by discipling a whole nation for God?&#x201d;<br><br>When one draws a circle around the borders of a nation<br>with the intention of discipling that whole nation, it doesn&#x2019;t<br>take long to realize that the most strategic person in that<br>nation is the president or king. But how could I ever hope to<br>even meet the many leaders of Africa?<br><br>Yet when I was training ninety-five hundred leaders in<br>Nigeria, I found myself invited to lunch with the president of<br>the nation, who told me that everywhere he traveled in the<br>world, someone would give him a copy of The Prayer of Jabez<br>and that the book had changed his life.<br><br>Then when I was in Zambia training more than seven<br>hundred leaders, the president of that nation invited me to<br>his office and told me he had just finished reading The Prayer<br>of Jabez&#x2014;twice. He came around his large desk and asked me<br>to place my hands on his shoulders and pray for him.<br><br>Later I was to speak with the president and first lady of<br>Uganda to find out firsthand how they had achieved a<br>remarkable turnaround and stemmed the tide of HIV<br>infection in their nation. The president was unexpectedly<br>called north to an outbreak of fighting, but his wife gave me<br>the warmest welcome and said, &#x201c;Oh, we love The Prayer of Jabez!<br>But Secrets of the Vine is my favorite.&#x201d;<br><br>As of this writing, I have just returned from Malawi,<br>where we were launching another Dream for Africa<br>ministry. Just before we were to fly back to Johannesburg, we<br>received word that the first lady of Malawi wanted to meet<br>with us. As we were introduced, the first lady&#x2019;s adult<br>daughter enthusiastically said to her mother, &#x201c;This is the<br>man I&#x2019;ve been telling you about, the one who wrote the book<br>I just gave you!&#x201d;<br><br>One leader said to me recently, &#x201c;The Prayer of Jabez is your<br>John the Baptist for your work in Africa!&#x201d;<br><br>Who could have guessed?<br><br><i>Why Another Book About Jabez?</i><br>If you were inspired by The Prayer of Jabez, or even if you&#x2019;ve<br>never heard of it, my hope is that this book will deeply<br>encourage you and enable you to live at a new level of<br>meaning, service, and significance. As I have been praying this<br>little prayer for more than thirty years, my heart is<br>overflowing with not only my own experiences but also how<br>God has answered this prayer for untold millions of people<br>around the world, and so I have shared a number of their<br>stories in these pages.<br><br>But Beyond Jabez was written for three primary reasons.<br><br>First, I wrote it to further develop the concepts in this<br>prayer so that they can produce even more fruit in your life.<br>The original book was only a brief overview of the prayer, and<br>so many people have asked for additional teaching on the<br>topic. In response, I developed an eight-part small-group<br>video series (available at www.brucewilkinson.com) and now<br>this book.<br><br>Second, I wrote Beyond Jabez to clear up some of the<br>misconceptions that have arisen out of the success of the first<br>book. Frankly, the amount of false teaching and preaching<br>that surrounded the book came as a complete shock to me.<br>Why? Because in twenty-five years of preaching on the prayer<br>of Jabez, I never heard one negative comment. And no one<br>ever even suggested that asking God to bless you was<br>prosperity gospel. Only after The Prayer of Jabez became a<br>runaway bestseller did I begin to hear this kind of criticism.<br>The secular press, in particular, had a difficult time handling<br>the overwhelming success of a book on prayer.<br><br>The third reason I wrote this new book was to encourage<br>you to rekindle the habit of praying the prayer of Jabez. So<br>many have been touched and their lives changed, but the<br>Jabez experience is hardly over; in fact, it&#x2019;s just beginning!<br><br>Rarely does a week go by when we don&#x2019;t see numerous<br>instances of God&#x2019;s answering this prayer in our family&#x2019;s lives<br>and at Dream for Africa. My good friend and publisher, Don<br>Jacobson, encouraged me to include in this book a number of<br>these stories from the past few months, just so readers would<br>see and understand that the prayer of Jabez can be an ongoing<br>part of a vital and effective prayer life.<br><br><i>A Life That Is More Honorable</i><br>Just as you ask God to bless your food, my hope is that after<br>reading Beyond Jabez, you will make it your habit to ask God to<br>bless you. Then, as you come to realize that your life is meant<br>to be ever growing in its influence and impact, I hope you will<br>ask God daily for more territory in which to serve Him. This<br>will lead you into the Land of the Unknown, where you may<br>feel overwhelmed and perhaps even incapable of handling the<br>opportunities; if so, I hope you will pray as Jabez did for the<br>hand of the Lord to intervene on your behalf. Finally, when<br>the reality of life on another plane causes your heart to<br>falter&#x2014;leaving you vulnerable to temptation that, if acted on,<br>would hurt the Lord and others and stop the miracles you&#x2019;ve<br>been experiencing&#x2014;my hope is you will know to ask the Lord<br>to keep evil from you so that you will not cause pain.<br><br>In this book, you will discover the power of this unbroken<br>linkage. And if you will pray the prayer of Jabez and live<br>according to its biblical principles, you too will discover the<br>indescribable joy of experiencing the words, &#x201c;And God<br>granted him that which he requested.&#x201d;<br><br>As you lose yourself in serving the King, you may find to<br>your surprise that heaven describes you, as it did Jabez, as<br>&#x201c;more honorable.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m convinced, from Scripture and<br>personal experience, that Jabez revealed one of the<br>remarkable secrets of a life that is honorable before God and<br>man. May your heart sing and your life explode with the joys<br>of living in the fullness that lies potentially before you.</p><h2>The Mystery of the Kidnapped Whale (Three Investigators Mystery Series)</h2><p>The three investigators, attempting to rescue a beached whale, end up searching for sunken treasure.</p><p></p><h2>Shades of Gray</h2><p>At the end of the Civil War, twelve-year-old Will, having lost all his immediate family, reluctantly leaves his city home to live in the Virginia countryside with his aunt and the uncle he considers a &#34;traitor&#34; because he refused to take part in the war.</p><p>Orphaned by the Civil War, 12-year-old Ben learns some unexpected truths from his Uncle Jed, a "coward" who refused to fight in the war; PW said, "thoughtfully told, the novel captures the hardships that followed the last war fought on U.S. soil."

The grieving father of a murdered seventeen-year-old woman admits that he should have been more involved in his daughter&#39;s life and paid attention to the &#34;friends&#34; in her immediate circle. Most of us only half-listen to the public service announcements about safety in the home. We lock our doors at night, but do little else to change habits that may make us the next victims of the dangerous individuals who are always on the watch for their next opportunity.This book takes readers through the mindset of predatory criminals - their motives, various plans of attack, and way of thinking - and then teaches simple lifestyle techniques that will help reduce the risk of becoming victimized. Criminal behavior specialists Greg Cooper and Mike King provide expert analysis based on real-life cases, in addition to moving insights from victims and criminals themselves. The authors make the point that the people who commit these crimes aren&#39;t much different from the predators of the wild, preying on the weak and unsuspecting. What makes these individuals more dangerous than their instinctive wildlife counterparts, however, is that they consciously choose to inflict their will on the more vulnerable members of their own species. To protect our loved ones and ourselves requires that we truly educate ourselves about the predators who live in our society and then take appropriate action. This excellent, in-depth study will help readers lead safer lives.</p><p><b>Gregory M.

They range from the mid-seventeenth-century to the present day and represent a three-dimensional archive of unique importance and authority. Treated as historical evidence, these models offer more detail than even the most detailed plans, and demonstrate exactly what the ships looked like in a way that the finest marine painter could not.<p>This book takes a selection of the best models from the beginning of the eighteenth century to the end of wooden shipbuilding to describe and demonstrate the development of warship construction in all its complexity. For this purpose, it reproduces a large number of photos, all in full color, and includes many close-up and detail views. These are captioned in depth, but many are also annotated to focus attention on interesting or unusual features. Although pictorial in emphasis, the book weaves the illustrations into an authoritative text, producing an unusual and attractive form of technical history.<br></p></p><p><b>BRIAN LAVERY</b> is one of the country's leading maritime historians and the author of more than thirty books, including the highly successful <i>Nelson's Navy</i> and <i>Empire of the Seas</i>. He was for many years a curator at the National Maritime Museum and while there became an expert on its models, producing the definitive work on the collection.<br>"If you like ships, especially wooden military ones, this book will teach you a great deal. A high-quality book which is recommended to all ship historians and modellers" - <i><b>Military Modelling</b></i><br><br>"This book includes plentiful visual representations of actual ships in model form and the accompanying graphics make for wonderful reading. Even if you do not read a single word in the book the models alone create enough gog in a person of any age. The models were all built to scale and the attention to detail is mesmerizing.... The pages are crisp, the illustrations and photos are clear, and I cannot express enough how enjoyable this book is to read." <b><i>--Spotter Up</i></b></p><h2>A Failed Empire: The Soviet Union in the Cold War from Stalin to Gorbachev (New Cold War History)</h2><p>Western interpretations of the Cold War--both realist and neoconservative--have erred by exaggerating either the Kremlin's pragmatism or its aggressiveness, argues Vladislav Zubok. Explaining the interests, aspirations, illusions, fears, and misperceptions of the Kremlin leaders and Soviet elites, Zubok offers a Soviet perspective on the greatest standoff of the twentieth century.<br><br>Using recently declassified Politburo records, ciphered telegrams, diaries, and taped conversations, among other sources, Zubok explores the origins of the superpowers' confrontation under Stalin, Khrushchev's contradictory and counterproductive attempts to ease tensions, the surprising story of Brezhnev's passion for detente, and Gorbachev's destruction of the Soviet superpower as the by-product of his hasty steps to end the Cold War and to reform the Soviet Union. The first work in English to cover the entire Cold War from the Soviet side, <i>A Failed Empire</i> provides a history different from those written by the Western victors.<br><br><br><br></p><p>"This book is the best history we have of the Soviet side of the Cold War.

He makes use of the most recently available sources and brings to their interpretation an unusually sharp mind."--William Taubman, Amherst College <br><p>Vladislav Zubok is professor of international history, with expertise on the Cold War, the Soviet Union, Stalinism, and Russia&#x2019;s intellectual history in the 20th century</p> <p>Professor Zubok was born and educated in Moscow.

An entertaining and inspiring story. --Senator George J. Mitchell</p><p>John J. Pullen, a renowned Civil War historian, also wrote Joshua Chamberlain: A Hero&#39;s Life and Legacy (978-0-8117-0886-9). He lived in Maine, writing about the Civil War until his death in 2003.Recently, Joshua Chamberlain has emerged in the popular mind as the archetypal Union military hero, based largely on the actions of his regiment, the 20th Maine, at Gettysburg. His image now appears on T-shirts, and he has been immortalized in film and in prose. In short, his lifelong effort to fashion a heroic image of himself has prevailed. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Pullen's brief examination of Chamberlain's postwar life. Pullen, whose previous work includes a marvelous study of the 20th Maine, falls prey to uncritical hero worship, unpersuasively portraying Chamberlain as a martyr to his belief in sectional reconciliation while unquestioningly accepting his minimal interest in the fate of the freedmen. Pullen does remind us that Chamberlain pursued a public career in Maine politics and at Bowdoin College, but the patchwork nature of the prose, the author's ruminations about today's world, the acceptance of Chamberlain's words at face value, and the unyielding admiration of author for subject result in a flawed book.?Brooks D.

But what do we mean by civilization? We believe in a Western tradition of freedom that has produced a fulfilling existence for many millions of people and a culture of enormous depth and creative power. But the history of our civilization is also filled with unspeakable brutality&#x2015;for every Leonardo there is a Mussolini, for every Beethoven symphony a concentration camp, for every Chrysler Building a My Lai massacre.<br><br> An ambitious historical assessment of the Western world&#x2015;tying together the histories of empires, art, philosophy, science, and politics&#x2015;<em>Civilization</em> reexamines and confronts us with all of our glories and catastrophes. At such a dangerous time in the world's history, this brilliant book is required reading.</p><p>For many years Roger Osborne worked as an editor in the London publishing world, first at Macmillan and then Faber &amp; Faber, specializing in books on medicine, psychology, and the history of science. Since 1992 he has been a full-time writer, using particular subjects to demonstrate new ways of understanding the past. He is a Fellow of the Geological Society and lives in Yorkshire.This stimulating survey steers a middle course between triumphal pageant of progress and postmodern bricolage of clashing perspectives to attempt a coherent narrative of Western history. Historian Osborne (<i>The Floating Egg: Episodes in the Making of Geology</i>) traces a lucid, thoughtful overview of European and American history from Stonehenge and the Greco-Roman era to the present. Tying together his account are a few broad themes, most prominently the development of rationalism&#x2014;the use of abstract reasoning to uncover universal laws governing nature and society&#x2014;from its Platonic origins to its apotheosis in Western science and its malevolent influence on Soviet communism. This often sinister rationalism works in counterpoint, and sometimes opposition, to what he sees as the redeeming organicity of Western culture, its rootedness in human adaptation to changing environments and practical needs in a multitude of contexts, from the growth of medieval towns to the rise of Hollywood and rock 'n' roll. Some pronouncements, like Osborne's insistence on the unique ferocity of Western warfare, aren't persuasive, and the paragraph he accords the Rolling Stones' 1969 Altamont concert is one too many. But one judges such a book less by its historiographical synthesis than by the wealth of provocative insights it throws up, and by that measure Osborne succeeds admirably.

He lives in Palm Springs, California, with his wife, Diane. Visit his website at Neiderman.com.*Starred Review* Without the 1998 cult horror film by the same name, this 1981 psychodrama may have slid off the map entirely&#x2014;a crime, considering just how terrifically upsetting it is. Leon and Ursula are teenagers living alone in a mansion after the death of their wealthy parents. Well, not entirely alone. They are joined by Pin, the full-sized, translucent medical dummy with which their physician father amused patients by throwing his voice. (This is the point where, if you&#x2019;re the nervous type, you slowly back away from the book.) As children, Leon and Ursula treated Pin as a confidant, though now that they&#x2019;re older, it&#x2019;s only Leon who holds entire two-sided conversations with him while Ursula plays along. It&#x2019;s a bizarre stasis indeed, but everybody is happy&#x2014;until the day Ursula brings home a boyfriend who has a damning diagnosis of Leon: &#x201c;He&#x2019;s as loony as can be.&#x201d; With the family trio threatened, Leon and Pin hatch a plan&#x2014;it involves hypodermic needles&#x2014;to rid themselves of this new bother. Yes, it&#x2019;s a heck of a plot synopsis, though it can&#x2019;t convey Leon&#x2019;s calm, aristocratic first-person narration, nor does it touch upon the queasy, incestual relationship that turns the siblings&#x2019; every interaction into the kind of barely hidden perversity V.

The film is derived from the real-life story of Peruvian rubber baron Carlos Fermin Fitzcarrald. In his autobiographical film &#34;Portrait Werner Herzog&#34;, Herzog has stated that the film&#39;s spectacular production was an incredible ordeal. It famously involved moving a 320-ton steamship over a hill without the use of special effects. Herzog believes that no one has ever performed a similar feat in history, and likely never will again, calling himself &#39;Conquistador of the Useless&#39;. The casting of the film was also quite difficult. Jason Robards was originally cast in the title role, but he became ill and was forced to leave. Herzog then considered casting Jack Nicholson, and even playing Fitzcarraldo himself, before Klaus Kinski accepted the role. By that point, forty percent of shooting was complete and Herzog insisted on a total reshoot with Kinski. Mick Jagger was originally cast as Fitzcarraldo&#39;s assistant Wilbur, but his shooting schedule expired and he departed to tour with the Rolling Stones. Though none of the major cast members spoke English natively, the original soundtrack was recorded in English, as it was the only language common to the lead actors. Klaus Kinski himself was a major source of tension, as he fought with Herzog and other members of the crew. In his documentary &#34;My Best Fiend&#34;, Herzog says that one of the local Peruvian chiefs who was an extra in the film offered to murder Kinski for him, but Herzog declined because he needed Kinski to complete filming. Les Blank&#39;s documentary &#34;Burden of Dreams&#34;, about the production of the film, also documents these many hardships. Herzog won the 1982 Best Director at Cannes for the film, which was hailed by critics around the globe.</p><p>Werner Herzog: in search of 'ecstatic truth' A feature about the german director --The Sunday Times &amp; Times Online 26th April 2009<p>One of the most revered filmmakers of our time, Werner Herzog wrote this diary during the making of <em>Fitzcarraldo</em>, the lavish 1982 film that tells the story of a would-be rubber baron who pulls a steamship over a hill in order to access a rich rubber territory. Later, Herzog spoke of his difficulties when making the film, including casting problems, reshoots, language barriers, epic clashes with the star, and the logistics of moving a 320-ton steamship over a hill without the use of special effects.</p><p>Hailed by critics around the globe, the film went on to win Herzog the 1982 Outstanding Director Prize at Cannes. <em>Conquest of the Useless</em>, Werner Herzog's diary on his fever dream in the Amazon jungle, is an extraordinary glimpse into the mind of a genius during the making of one of his greatest achievements.</p></p><h2>Eyeshield 21, Vol. 1</h2><p>What does a wimpy kid who&#39;s been bullied all his life have to depend on but his own two feet?

He won the 122th HopStep Award prize(1995) by "Partner." and won the 51th Akatsuka Award 2nd prize(1998) by "Samui Hanashi."<p></p>The underdog-with-exceptional-ability-makes-good plot is typical of boys' manga, but seeing another country's view of a great American competitive sport&#x2014;in this case, football&#x2014;provides added entertainment. Since football isn't a popular sport in Japan, Sena Kobayakawa's school's team only has two players: Ryokan, a large, friendly boy who dreams of someday competing in the Christmas bowl game, and Hiruma, the quarterback better known for frightening the underclassmen. At 5'1", Sena has always been smaller than his classmates, so he's been used as their gofer and errand boy. As a result, he's developed outstanding running speed. He wants to be team manager, but he winds up competing under the name Eyeshield 21 to keep other teams from knowing his name and stealing him away. The three must recruit enough players to form a team of 11 in order to play their first game. The thin-line art style gives the players a certain delicate beauty, while exaggerated reactions put readers directly in touch with the characters' emotions. Game scenes are drawn in loving detail that captures football's violent grandeur. This promises to be Viz's third sports hit, joining popular series on tennis and soccer. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her most recent picture book, <em>Dear Mr. Washington</em>, is inspired by&#xfffd;&#xfffd;&#xfffd;Gilbert Stuart's famed portraits of the first president of the United States. Lynn&#xfffd;&#xfffd;&#xfffd;lives in Atlanta with her husband, their dog, and their two cats.</p> <br>Welsh legend has it that as a boy, 12th-century Prince Llywelyn was blessed with a faithful dog named Gelert, and this strange and sentimental retelling marks novelist Cullen's (Stink Bomb; The Backyard Ghost) picture book debut. Llywelyn and his canine companion are inseparable until he marries a cold princess and begins to ignore his true-hearted dog. One day, the couple's newborn son is missing and Llywelyn, discovering Gelert near the crib with a bloody mouth, raises his sword to the animal, only to find the infant safe and a dead wolf outside. Gelert then disappears, and Llywelyn is doomed to a life of regret. Later the prince is redeemed when the heroic beast reappears to him in two mysterious ways. Though somewhat stilted language dots the prose ("With an anguished roar, Llywelyn attacked Gelert"), the period setting and compelling plot will carry readers along. In a remarkable debut, Long crafts oil paintings that resemble medieval tapestries: steeped in a wide array of greens, sprinkled with blood reds and burgundies and teeming with flower and fauna. Her close-up renderings of expressive faces against deep landscapes of rolling hills and turbulent skies give the tale an epic quality.

People flock to see the latest head and gossip about the state of the empire: the province of Albania is demanding independence again, and the niche awaits a new trophy . . . <br><br> Tundj Hata, the imperial courier, is charged with transporting heads to the capital&#x2015;a task he relishes and performs with fervor. As he travels through obscure and impoverished territories, he makes money from illicit side-shows, offering villagers the spectacle of death. The head of the rebellious Albanian governor would fetch a very high price indeed.<br><br> <i>The Traitor's Niche</i>&nbsp;is a surreal tale of tyranny and rebellion, in a land where armies carry scarecrows, state officials ban entire languages, and the act of forgetting is more complicated than remembering.</p><p><b>ISMAIL KADARE</b> is Albania's best-known novelist and poet. Translations of his novels have appeared in more than forty countries. He was awarded the inaugural Man Booker International Prize in 2005, and the Jerusalem Prize in 2015. <br><br> <b>JOHN HODGSON</b> studied at Cambridge and Newcastle and has taught at the universities of Prishtina and Tirana. This is the fifth novel by Ismail Kadare that he has translated.1<br> At the Centre of the Empire<br><br> The unblinking eyes met the stares of the �passers-�by and tourists who poured into the square from all directions. The tourists' own gaze, like that of all moving crowds, was mild and unfocused, but people's eyes suddenly froze as soon as they encountered this sight, as if their astonished pupils struggled to sink back into the depths of their skulls, and only the impossibility of doing this compelled them to stand still and face what they saw. Most went pale, some wanted to vomit. Only a few looked on calmly. The eyes were indifferent, of a colour you could not call bluish or even grey, and which it was hard to name, because it was less a colour than the distant reflection of a void.<br> <p>Looking away at last, the clusters of tourists would ask how to get to Hagia Sophia, to the tombs of the sultan-�emperors, the bank, the old bathhouses, the Palace of Dreams. They enquired hurriedly and feverishly, yet most did not leave the square but wandered round as if caught in a trap. Although not particularly large, the square was one of the most famous in the ancient imperial capital. Paved with green granite, it appeared to be cast in bronze, and its splendour was yet further enhanced by the metal lions' heads behind the railings enclosing the Central State Archive. Above the wing of the Archive peered not only the �lead-�tipped minaret of the Sultan's Mosque, but also the Obelisk of Tokmakhan, brought over a few centuries ago to commemorate the invasion of Egypt, and decorated with hieroglyphs and the different emblems of the empire all cast in metal, and finally the Cannon Gate, in whose walls was carved the Traitor's Niche. In the language of the country, this niche was called the stone of <i>ibret</i>, a word which might loosely be translated as 'deterrence'.</p> <p>It was not hard to imagine why this square had been chosen for the niche where the severed heads of rebel viziers or �ill-�starred senior officials were placed. Perhaps nowhere else could the eyes of �passers-�by so easily grasp the inter�dependency between the imposing solidity of the ancient square and the human heads that had dared to show it disrespect. It was clear at once that the niche had been sited in the wall to convey the impression that the head's lifeless eyes surveilled every corner of the square. In this way, even the feeblest and least imaginative �passer-�by could visualise, at least for a moment, his own head displayed at this unnatural height. When the head's hair fluttered forlornly in the wind, the contrast between those soft wisps and the solid monuments of the square, especially the lions' manes, was a sight beyond endurance. The square had an extraordinary solemnity, metal and stone coming together everywhere. Even on the terrace of the caf� opposite, metal was present in the copper utensils used for the fragile and human act of drinking coffee.</p> <p>The former government �news-�criers who had now retired due to age or professional incapacity, having lost their voices, were among those who usually came here to drink coffee. The caf� owner told Abdulla, the keeper of the Traitor's Niche, how their conversation was restricted entirely to old news and the decrees they had once proclaimed to every corner of the state.</p> <p>In the morning, before the square came to life, Abdulla liked to observe the caf�. After his working hours, he also liked to sit at one of the little tables, but rarely did so, because the doctor had told him that coffee was bad for his health. Abdulla was �thirty-�one years old, but there was no strength in his lanky limbs. At times, a ringing in his ears drained him of all energy. Like everything else on this square, the coffee was too potent. Despite this, Abdulla risked a cup now and then. On these occasions he preferred to join the table of the old �news-�criers. In the past their voices had made glass windows shake, but now only a pitiful squeak emerged from their throats. The caf� owner said he could easily understand why they considered the decrees of yesteryear more impressive than those of today, just as they themselves had outshone the modern criers. The caf� owner said that the criers, almost without exception, could remember the day they had lost their voices, and not just the day, but the decree they were issuing, and the very phrase at which their vocal cords had given out forever. 'That's what people are like,' he went on bitterly. 'They never forget anything.'</p> <p>Watching the swarm of people, Abdulla felt sure that the caf� owner was right and that people deserved the shock that the niche gave them. He knew that the sight of a severed head was not something everybody could stomach, but Abdulla always found that the horror and distress in the spectators' faces went beyond all expectation. It was the eyes in the head that seemed to strike them most, and not because they were dead eyes, but perhaps because people were accustomed to human eyes making an impression on them when connected to a human body with arms and legs. Abdulla thought that the absence of a body made the eyes larger and more significant than they really were.</p> <p>Indeed, it seemed to Abdulla that people in general were less significant than they thought themselves to be. Sometimes, when dusk drew near and the moon cast its light prematurely on the square, he even thought that human beings, himself included, were only a pollutant that spoilt the splendour and harmony of the imperial square. He could not wait for the square to empty entirely so that, although his official working hours were over, he could observe everything in the calm, icy moonlight. Sometimes the light fell at a certain angle on the niche and for an instant the illuminated head would assume a derisive or disdainful expression. The head, now free of human limbs, seemingly useless appendages, appeared slightly worthier of taking its place among the ancient symbols and emblems of the square. At these moments, Abdulla would be seized by a thrilling paroxysm of �self-�destruction, an obscure subconscious desire to throw off the ungainly tangle of his limbs and become only a head.</p> <p>During the day, Abdulla's face wore a permanently rigid expression. This was fitting as long as he was on duty. In a way, he was forced to adapt himself to the stony aspect of the square. He was the keeper of one of its most important symbolic sites, and he had to look the part. However, although Abdulla stood only a few paces from the niche and it was obvious that he and he alone was in charge of it, nobody took any notice of him. Everybody's eyes were fixed in wonder on the niche. Abdulla felt a faint spasm of jealousy, as if this feeling were mixed in a huge pot with all kinds of other emotions.</p> <p>For the thousandth time he looked at all the features of the square in turn, as if to measure, should he be counted as one of them, how far he fell short of the necessary perfection. Only the hieroglyphs on the Egyptian obelisk were on a similarly diminutive scale and less than majestic. They resembled insects that had become petrified while crawling up the pillar. Sometimes, when he did not feel well, it seemed to Abdulla that the hieroglyphs had suddenly come to life and started to move, as if trying to wriggle free from the grip of stone and metal and set off like nomads towards the desert. But this happened rarely, and only when he was particularly exhausted. Still more rare were his moments of extreme weakness when he thought of escaping in the same way, like a beetle, out of this granite vice.</p></p><h2>Dragon Ball Z, Vol. 26 (26)</h2><p>After years of training and adventure, Goku has become Earth&#39;s ultimate warrior. and his son, Gohan, shows even greater promise.

Why? Because sales = income. Yet, many fail financially not because they do not have great ideas or even good work ethic, but typically because they don't know how to, refuse to, are afraid to, or don't think it is important to know how to sell. <p></p>SalesDogs was written as the very first of the Rich Dad Poor Dad "how-to" Advisory series to teach in a very fun and impactful way how to overcome the fears, the myths and the obstacles to selling your products, services or yourself. It then teaches a simple, time-proven process of selling that will generate great income in most any business. The reader will learn the five most important selling skills to master, how to overcome any objection, manage a territory and much more. <p></p>The book quickly de-bunks the idea that you have to be an overly aggressive "attack dog" to be successful. It uses the metaphor of "man's best friend" to say that a great sales person is like a loyal, persistent and lovable canine. It stipulates that there are five different "breeds" or personalities of SalesDogs that can each make a lot of money by playing to its strength. You will learn how to identify, maximize and train to that strength and also how to teach others on your team to do the same. <p></p>While the book is fun and engaging, it also dives deep into the personal development issues that block a person's ability to generate income and how to overcome them.

With archival photographs and text among other primary sources, this riveting biography of Mary Mallon by the Sibert medalist and Newbery Honor winner Susan Bartoletti looks beyond the tabloid scandal of Mary&#39;s controversial life. How she was treated by medical and legal officials reveals a lesser-known story of human and constitutional rights, entangled with the science of pathology and enduring questions about who Mary Mallon really was. How did her name become synonymous with deadly disease? And who is really responsible for the lasting legacy of Typhoid Mary? This thorough exploration includes an author&#39;s note, timeline, annotated source notes, and bibliography.</p><p><b>Susan Campbell Bartoletti</b> is the award-winning author of several books for young readers, including <i>Black Potatoes: The Story of the Great Irish Famine, 1845&#x2013;1850,</i> winner of the Robert F. Sibert Medal. She lives in Moscow, Pennsylvania. Visit her website at&nbsp;<b>www.scbartoletti.com</b>.Gr 5 Up&#x2014;This well-researched biography of Mary Mallon, also known as Typhoid Mary, begins in 1906, when Mallon was hired as a cook for a wealthy family vacationing in Oyster Bay, Long Island. The outbreak of typhoid that swept through the household a few weeks later turned out to be a pivotal event that forever changed her life. George Soper, a sanitation engineer and typhoid expert, was hired to discover the source of the disease. He eventually determined that Mallon was what was known as a healthy carrier: although she experienced no symptoms of typhoid, her body continued to produce the bacteria, which she inadvertently shed. Soper took his discovery to the New York City Board of Health, and soon thereafter, Mallon was arrested and quarantined against her will on North Brother Island. Mallon has often been described as ignorant and a menace to society due to her refusal to stop working as a cook when she was later briefly released from quarantine, but Bartoletti tells the woman's story with empathy and understanding. The author also explores the myriad violations of Mallon's civil rights and her unusually harsh treatment in comparison to other healthy typhoid carriers (nationwide 50 carriers were identified at the time, but only Mary was quarantined). Energetic, even charming prose (chapter headings include "In Which Mrs. Warren Has a Servant Problem") will easily engage readers. Pair this work with Gail Jarrow's Fatal Fever: Tracking Down Typhoid Mary (Boyds Mills, 2015).

I suppose so.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A yeti never shaves.&#x201d; Leaning close, as if imparting a secret, Deucalion said, &#x201c;Under all that hair, a yeti has very sensitive skin.

But these leaders won't simply come to the fore; we have to <i>develop</i> them, and we must cultivate them as quickly as is humanly possible. <i>Changing on the Job</i> is a means to this end. As opposed to showing readers how to play the role of a leader in a "paint by numbers" fashion, <i>Changing on the Job</i> builds on theories of adult growth and development to help readers become more thoughtful individuals, capable of leading in any scenario. Moving from the theoretical to the practical, and employing real-world examples, author Jennifer Garvey Berger offers a set of building blocks to help cultivate an agile workforce while improving performance. Coaches, HR professionals, thoughtful leaders, and anyone who wants to flourish on the job will find this book a vital resource for developing their own capacities and those of the talent that they support.</p><p><b>Jennifer Garvey Berger</b> uses her expertise in complexity of mind to support leaders around the world through coaching and leadership development programs. She is a Partner in Cultivating Leadership, a leadership development consultancy. For more information, please visit www.garveyberger.com."Helping leaders grow to meet the challenges of today's business environment is a project that has been taken up by many writers. Our world is complex and it presents many risks and threats, and it gives rise to behavior that is aggressive or defensive, self-interested, and frequently destructive. The question is whether it is possible for people to develop beyond such behavior. Berger's book offers a practical answer by providing a developmental framework for learning and an approach to guiding people towards more empowering forms of thinking . . . The key question is: how do people develop from one stage of thinking to the next? How do they change their view of the world and their way of thinking? The great value of Berger's book is that this is the central focus. Having presented examples of situations where different modes of thinking lead to conflict, she walks the reader through processes that can help to bring the differences in thinking to the surface, and thereby make room for new approaches. And perhaps this is the most important work that needs to be done in workplaces."

Signature<i>Reviewed by</i> Brenda ShaughnessyMarie Howe's books of poetry materialize once a decade and are big news and cause for celebration. Both of her previous collections moved me to tears and have continued to move me. Reading her third is like finally having a very long thirst quenched. Howe's debut, <i>The Good Thief</i>, contains a poem, Part of Eve's Discussion, which remains one of the most breathtaking out-of-body experiences in contemporary poetry: ...when it occurs to you/ your car could spin/.../ it was like that, and after that, it was still like that, only/ all the time. When I teach poetry classes, this is what I start with: it makes young poets want to write. Then there are the rapt, anguished poems about all-too-corporeal experiences in <i>What the Living Do</i>, which struggles to reckon with a beloved brother's death from AIDS as well as a rough-and-tumble childhood. Howe finds the flash point of illumination in the chaos of grief and murky memory. This book has become a classic text in coping with life, love and loss. How do we save each other, or how do we watch helplessly? How can we live with our memories or with losing them, or each other? Howe is the rare poet who offers answers to these questions. This third book unites and develops all the strength and beauty of the previous two. Metaphysical aspects of <i>Thief</i> find advanced life forms in mind-benders like Limbo (Do I have an I?/ One says to another... ) and Easter. a brilliant short poem about reanimation (And the whole body was too small. Imagine/ the sky trying to fit into a tunnel carved into a hill). The earthbound qualities of <i>Living</i> also find new form here: political, indeed global concerns are posited with signature clarity, expressing, through simple observation and empathy, the hope for more humane systems. A cycle of heartbreaking poems about motherhood, called Life of Mary, looks back on the speaker's own dead mother, while other poems look straight into the moment, joyfully, reverently and always with a pause for reflection and amazement, with her daughter.Howe is a careful and soulful alchemist. She makes metaphor matter and material metaphysical. She becomes magic with her transforming perspective that is part mother, part muscle, part music, part mind. This book has the amazing thing that Howe always seems to pull off: the miracle. I saw it./ It was the thing and spirit both: the real/ world: evident, invisible. <i>(Mar.)</i><i></i>Brenda Shaughnessy is the author of Interior with Sudden Joy <i></i>(FSG, 1999) and the forthcoming Human Dark with Sugar <i></i>(Copper Canyon, 2008), which won the 2007 James Laughlin Award.

Hook-nosed riding teachers, riders on backward, and horses gone madly off course. The artist Norman Thelwell published his first pony cartoon in 1953, and quite by accident, his name became synonymous with these kinds of images. The response was instantaneous,&#x201d; he wrote in his autobiography. Suddenly I had fan mail I dreamed up some more horsey ideas and people went into raptures.&#x201d; The Thelwell pony&#x201d; soon became the most-often referenced source of horse-humor the world over. In 1957, Thelwell&#x2019;s first collection of pony cartoons, Angels on Horseback, was published, followed by A Leg at Each Corner in 61, and Riding Academy in &#x2019;63.<br><br>In this Anniversary Special Collection, readers get all three classics, featuring page after page of Thelwell&#x2019;s hilarious cartoons along with his often blisteringly accurate advice for survival in and around the equine herd. Whether audiences open Pony Calvacade out of nostalgia or curiosity, the delightful details of Thelwell&#x2019;s illustrations and timeless wit of his caricatures and asides are a surefire way to change a day for the better, and certain to send a new generation of fat-hairy-pony-lovers out to the barn to test the truths within.<br></p><p><b>Norman Thelwell</b> (3 May 1923 &#x2013; 7 February 2004) was born in Birkenhead, Cheshire, on 3 May 1923. His earliest surviving drawing is a pencil self-portrait done at the age of 10, on which his teacher has written in red ink: 'V. good indeed'. He remembers always wanting to draw as a child and recalls finding drawing and painting much easier than other subjects - 'with drawing, the answer was always there in front of you - you only had to look'. His love of the countryside was fostered by childhood visits to a North Wales farm and was strengthened throughout his life.<br><br>He joined the Army in 1941 and, through the years of war which followed, both in Britain and in India, he always travelled with his sketchbooks. The first cartoon he ever had reproduced was an Indian subject for the London Opinion. In 1945, at Nottingham Art School evening classes, he met fellow student Rhona whom he married in 1949. After the war, he took a degree course at Liverpool College of Art and in 1950 he started teaching design and illustration at Wolverhampton College of Art.<br> <br>His first cartoon for Punch was published in 1952 and led to a relationship which lasted for 25 years and over 1,500 cartoons, including 60 front covers. His first pony cartoon was published in 1953 and, by accident, led to a lifetime of association with the image of the little girl and the fat hairy pony. As he says in his autobiography: "I was a sort of unofficial country cartoonist, doing funny drawings that involved birds, cattle, pigs and poultry. <br><br>One day I did a pony drawing and it was like striking a sensitive nerve. The response was instantaneous. People telephoned the editor and asked for more. Suddenly I had fan mail. So the editor told me to do a two-page spread on ponies. I was appalled. I thought I'd already squeezed the subject dry. I looked at the white drawing block and wondered what on earth to do. In the end I dreamed up some more horsey ideas and people went into raptures." The "Thelwell pony" was born.<br><br>Thelwell left teaching to take up illustration full-time in 1956 and his first book, a collection of his cartoons, <i>Angels on Horseback</i>, was published in 1957. The first book produced from cover to cover rather than collected from drawings previously published was <i>A Leg at Each Corner</i>, published in 1961. This was serialized in the Sunday Express and led to the development of the strip cartoon characters Penelope and Kipper.<br><br>Thelwell's range as a cartoonist has gone far beyond ponies--fishing, gardening, house-hunting, motoring, sailing, dogs, cats, farming, stately homes, children and country pursuits have all been given the treatment.<br>He was a master of sharp social comment and sheer zany humor, and the foibles of the British at work or at play were his favorite themes. He was also a serious landscape artist, painting in watercolor and oils. His 34 books have sold over 2 million copies in the UK and been translated into languages as diverse as Finnish and Japanese and his drawings have been used on many different kinds of merchandise including stationery, jigsaws, table mats, china, glass, door mats, socks and bed linen.<br><br>This classic will have you roaring with laughter�Without question horse lovers of every age will thoroughly enjoy this book.

Tossing his card-chips on the table, the young gambler halfheartedly collected what they&#x2019;d earned him, an indifferent addition to his already indifferent profits for the evening. Something on the unspectacular order of five hundred credits.<br> &nbsp;<br> Perhaps it was the heat. Or just his imagination.<br> &nbsp;<br> This blasted asteroid, Oseon 2795, while closer to its sun than most, was as carefully life-supported and air-conditioned as any developed rock in the system. Still, one could almost feel the relentless solar flux hammering down upon its sere and withered surface, feel the radiation soaking through its iron-nickel substance, feel the unwanted energy reradiating from the walls in every room.<br> &nbsp;<br> Especially this one.<br> &nbsp;<br> Apparently the locals felt it, too. They&#x2019;d stripped right down to shorts and shirt-sleeves after the second hand, two hours earlier, and looked fully as fatigued and grimy as the young gambler felt. He took a sip from his glass, the necessity for circumspection regarding what he drank blessedly absent for once. No nonsense here about comradely alcohol consumption. Most of them were having ice water and liking it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Beads of moisture had condensed into a solid sheet on the container&#x2019;s outer surface and trickled down his wrist into his gold-braided uniform sleeve.<br> &nbsp;<br> What a way to live! Oseon 2795 was a pocket of penury in a plutocrat&#x2019;s paradise. The drab mining asteroid, thrust cruelly near the furnace of furnaces, orbited through a system of pleasure resorts and vacation homes for the galaxy&#x2019;s superwealthy, like an itinerant junkman.<br> &nbsp;<br> The gambler was wishing at the moment that he&#x2019;d never heard of the place. That&#x2019;s what came of taking advice from spaceport attendants. A trickle of moisture ran down his neck into the upright collar of his semiformal uniform. Who said hardrock miners were always rich?<br> &nbsp;<br> He shuffled the oversized deck once, twice, three times, twice again in listless ritual succession, passed it briefly for a perfunctory cut to the perspiring player on his right, dealt the cards around, two to a customer, and waited impatiently for the amateurs to assess their hands. Real or imagined, the heat seemed to slow everybody&#x2019;s mental processes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Initial bets were added to the ante in the middle of the table. It didn&#x2019;t amount to a great fortune by anybody&#x2019;s standards&#x2014;except perhaps the poverty-cautious participants in the evening&#x2019;s exercise in the mathematics of probability. To them the gambler was a romantic figure, a professional out-system adventurer with his own private starship and a reputation for outrageous luck. The backroom microcredit plungers were trying desperately to impress him, he realized sadly, and they were succeeding: at the present rate, he&#x2019;d have to drain the charge from his electric shaver into the ship&#x2019;s energy storage system, just to lift off the Core-forsaken planetoid.<br> &nbsp;<br> Having your own starship was not so much a matter of being able to buy it in the first place (he&#x2019;d won his in another sabacc game in the last system but one he&#x2019;d visited) as being able to afford to operate it. So far, he&#x2019;d lost money on the deal.<br> &nbsp;<br> Looking down, he saw he&#x2019;d dealt himself a minus-nine: Balance, plus the Two of Sabres. Not terribly promising, even at the best of times, but sabacc was a game of dramatic reversals, often at the turn of a single card-chip. Or even without turning it&#x2014;he watched the deuce with a thrill that never staled as the face of the electronic pasteboard blurred and faded, refocused and solidified as the Seven of Staves.<br> &nbsp;<br> That gave him a minus-four: insignificant progress, but progress nevertheless. He saw the current bet, flipping a thirty-credit token into the pot, but declined to raise.<br> &nbsp;<br> It also meant that the original Seven of Staves, in somebody&#x2019;s hand or in the undealt remainder of the deck, had been transformed into something altogether different. He watched the heat-flushed faces of the players, learning nothing. Each of the seventy-eight card-chips transformed itself at random intervals, unless it lay flat on its back within the shallow interference field of the gaming table. This made for a fast-paced, nerve-wracking game.<br> &nbsp;<br> The young gambler found it relaxing. Ordinarily.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take a card, please, Captain Calrissian.&#x201d; Vett Fori, the player in patched and faded denyms on the gambler&#x2019;s left, was the chief supervisor of the asteroid mining operation, a tiny, tough-looking individual of indeterminate age, with a surprisingly gentle smile hidden among the worry-lines. She&#x2019;d been betting heavily&#x2014;for that impecunious crowd, anyway&#x2014;and losing steadily, all evening, as if preoccupied by more than the heat. An unlit cigar rested on the table edge beside her elbow.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Please, call me Lando,&#x201d; the young gambler replied, dealing her a card-chip. &#x201c;&nbsp;&#x2018;Captain Calrissian&#x2019; sounds like the one-eyed commander of a renegade Imperial dreadnought. My Millennium Falcon&#x2019;s only a small converted freighter, and a rather elderly one at that, I&#x2019;m afraid.&#x201d; He watched her for an indication of the card she&#x2019;d taken. Nothing.<br> &nbsp;<br> A nasal chuckle sounded from across the table. Arun Feb, the supervisor&#x2019;s assistant, took a card as well. There was a hole frayed in the paunch of his begrimed singlet, and dark stains under his arms. Like his superior, he was small in stature. All the miners seemed to run that way. Compactness was undoubtedly a virtue among them. He had a dark, thick, closely cropped beard and a shiny pink scalp. Drawing on a cigar of his own, he frowned as he added what he&#x2019;d been dealt to the pair in his hand.<br> &nbsp;<br> Suddenly: &#x201c;Oh, for Edge&#x2019;s sake, I simply can&#x2019;t make up my mind! Can you come back to me, Captain Calrissian?&#x201d; Lando groaned inwardly. This was how the entire evening had gone so far: the speaker, Ottdefa Osuno Whett, for all his dithering, had been the consistent big winner, perhaps owing to his tactics of continuous annoyance of the others. Fully as much a stranger in the Oseon as the young starship captain, at the moment he was operating on considerably less goodwill.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Ottdefa, you know I can&#x2019;t. Will you have a card or not?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Whett assumed an expression of conspicuous concentration that might have been a big success in his university classes. Ottdefa was a title, something academic or scientific, Lando gathered, conferred in the Lekua System. It was the equivalent of &#x201c;Professor.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Its owner was a spindly wraith, ridiculously tall, gray-headed, with a high-pitched whiny voice and a chronically indecisive manner. It had taken him twenty minutes to order a drink at the beginning of the game&#x2014;and even then he&#x2019;d changed his order just as the drink arrived.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lando didn&#x2019;t like him.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, very well. If you insist, I&#x2019;ll take a card.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; Lando dealt it. Either the academic had an excellent poker face, or he was too absentminded to notice whether the resulting hand was bad or good. Lando looked to his right. &#x201c;Constable Phuna?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The squat, curly-headed tough-guy he addressed was T. Lund Phuna, local representative of law-and-order under the Administrator Senior of the Oseon. It was not, apparently, the happiest of assignments in the field. The uniform tunic hanging soddenly over the back of his chair looked nearly as worn as his companions&#x2019; work clothes. He lit cigarette after cigarette with nervous, sweaty fingers, filling the cramped, already stifling room with more pollution. He wiped a perspiration-soaked tissue over his jowls.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll stand. Nothing for me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Dealer takes a card.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was the Idiot, worth zero. Given the circumstances, Lando felt it was altogether appropriate. If only he&#x2019;d headed for the Dela System as he&#x2019;d planned, instead of the Oseon. He&#x2019;d seen richer pickings in refugee camps.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bets were placed again. Vett Fori took another card, her fourth, as did her assistant, Arun Feb, asking for it around the stub of his cigar. Ottdefa Whett stood pat. A Master of Sabres brought the value of Lando&#x2019;s hand up to a positive ten, as a final round of wagering commenced.<br> &nbsp;<br> Arun Feb and Vett Fori both folded with a nine and minus-nine respectively. The cop Phuna hung grimly on, his broad features misted with sweat. Lando was about to resign himself, when Whett excitedly cried, &#x201c;Sabacc!&#x201d; slapping the Mistress of Staves, the Four of Flasks, and the Six of Coins down on the worn felt tabletop.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Ottdefa raked in a meager pot: &#x201c;Ah&nbsp;...&nbsp;not exactly the Imperial Crown jewels, nor even the fabulous Treasure of Rafa, but&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Treasure of Rafa?&#x201d; echoed Vett Fori.<br> &nbsp;<br> She might as well ask, thought Lando, she isn&#x2019;t doing herself any good playing cards.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard of the Rafa System,&#x201d; the mine supervisor continued, &#x201c;everybody has. It&#x2019;s the closest to our own. But I haven&#x2019;t heard of any treasure.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The academic cleared his throat. It was a silly, goose-honk noise. &#x201c;The Treasure of Rafa&#x2014;or of the Sharu, as we are now compelled to call it, not for the Rafa System, my dear, but for the ancient race who once flourished there and subsequently vanished without a trace&#x2014;is a subject of some interest.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> This had been delivered in Whett&#x2019;s best professional tones. Vett Fori&#x2019;s weathered face, impassive enough when it came to playing cards, plainly displayed annoyance at being patronized. She picked up her cigar, stuck it between her teeth, and glared across the table.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Without a trace?&#x201d; Arun Feb snorted with disbelief. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been there, friend, and those ruins of your&#x2014;what&#x2019;d you call &#x2019;em?&#x2014;&#x2018;Sharu,&#x2019; are the biggest hunks of engineering in the known galaxy. What&#x2019;s more, they cover every body in the system bigger than my thumbnail. They&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Are not themselves the Sharu, my dear fellow, of whom no trace remains,&#x201d; Whett insisted, his tone divided between pedantry and insulted reaction. &#x201c;I certainly ought to know, for, until recently, I was a research anthropologist for the new governor of the Rafa System.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s a bureaucrat want with a tame anthropologist?&#x201d; Feb asked blandly. He blew a final smoke ring, mashed his cigar out on the edge of the vacuum tray, and took a long drink of water. It dribbled down his chin, soaking the collar of his soiled shirt.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>U.S.S. Seawolf: Submarine Raider of the Pacific</h2><p><em><b>Aaaap! Aaaap!

For James Lang, cultural or sociological explanations like these are red herrings. His provocative new research indicates that students often cheat because their learning environments give them ample incentives to try--and that strategies which make cheating less worthwhile also improve student learning. <i>Cheating Lessons </i>is a practical guide to tackling academic dishonesty at its roots.</p><p>Drawing on an array of findings from cognitive theory, Lang analyzes the specific, often hidden features of course design and daily classroom practice that create opportunities for cheating. Courses that set the stakes of performance very high, that rely on single assessment mechanisms like multiple-choice tests, that have arbitrary grading criteria: these are the kinds of conditions that breed cheating. Lang seeks to empower teachers to create more effective learning environments that foster intrinsic motivation, promote mastery, and instill the sense of self-efficacy that students need for deep learning.</p><p>Although cheating is a persistent problem, the prognosis is not dire. The good news is that strategies which reduce cheating also improve student performance overall. Instructors who learn to curb academic dishonesty will have done more than solve a course management problem--they will have become better educators all around.</p></p><p>James M. Lang is Associate Professor of English at Assumption College and former assistant director of the Searle Center for Teaching Excellence at Northwestern University.&#x201c;Much of this book (and arguably the best part of the book) is simply about good teaching. Lang just believes, as many do, that good (and creative) teaching makes students less likely to cheat... Lang should also be congratulated for admitting a hard truth: no matter how good a class or professor, some students are simply going to cheat. And nothing is going to be able to stop this... Lang gives anyone who teaches a lot to think about. Plus, all educators who are looking for ways to shake things up in their classes should enjoy the second section of the book and walk away with some new perspectives on teaching.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Catherine Ramsdell</b><b>, </b><b><i>PopMatters</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This lively book combines a review of key studies of cheating, inspiring examples of active student efforts to stop academic dishonesty, and useful guidelines for how faculty and institutions can respond when it does occur.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Elizabeth Hayford</b><b>, </b><b><i>Library Journal (starred review)</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Practical and insightful... Whether tracking historical incidents of cheating to illustrate different factors, or discussing how university communities can talk to their students about academic dishonesty, Lang is an upbeat guide, effectively arguing that even small steps can help reduce the potential for cheating.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Lang&#x2019;s book serves as an excellent introduction to principles of effective teaching&#x2015;that is, teaching that leads to meaningful student learning. Happily, these principles also reduce student motivation to cheat, as Lang cogently argues. Faculty will find in <i>Cheating Lessons</i> many practical examples of ways they can implement these principles in their teaching.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Derek Bruff, Vanderbilt University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Lang reminds educators that their primary focus should be on promoting learning, and not on preventing cheating. This helpful book provides accessible summaries of literature on academic cheating, its nature, causes, and prevalence&#x2015;and illustrative examples of how successful instructors build their courses to encourage learning, and as a by-product, reduce cheating.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Colin S.

Consider the story of Eric Werner and Mya Henry, an intrepid young couple who gave up their restaurant jobs in New York City to start anew in the one-road town of Tulum, Mexico. Here they built Hartwood, one of the most exciting and inspiring restaurants in the world. Mya Henry took on the role of general manager, seeing to the overall operations and tending to the guests, while Eric Werner went to work magic in the kitchen.&nbsp;<br><br> The food served at Hartwood is &#x201c;addictive,&#x201d; says Noma chef Ren� Redzepi, adding, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the reason people line up for hours every single day to eat there, even though their vacation time is precious.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> Werner&#x2019;s passion for dazzling flavors and natural ingredients is expertly translated into recipes anyone can cook at home. Every dish has a balance of sweet and spicy, fresh and dried, oil and acid, without relying heavily on wheat and dairy. The flavoring elements are simple&#x2014;honeys, salts, fresh and dried herbs, fresh and dried chiles, onions, garlic&#x2014;but by using the same ingredients in different forms, Werner layers flavors to bring forth maximum deliciousness. The recipes are beautifully photographed and interspersed with inspiring, gorgeously illustrated essays about this setting and story, making <i>Hartwood</i> an exhilarating experience from beginning to end.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Chef Eric Werner began his culinary career at the Culinary Institute of America and honed his pastry skills at Payard in New York City. He then joined Wylie Dufresne&#x2019;s 71 Clinton Fresh Food. But it was at Peasant and later Vinegar Hill House in Brooklyn that his embrace of the primal, wood-fired cooking methods he&#x2019;d explored over campfires in his youth found full expression. Together with Mya Henry he owns and operates Hartwood in Tulum, Mexico.<br><br> As general manager and co-owner, Mya Henry is the front-of-the-house presence at Hartwood, where she oversees all operations, including the happiness of the guests.<br> &nbsp;<br> Christine Muhlke is Executive Editor of <i>Bon App�tit</i> and a sought-after cookbook collaborator. Oliver Strand writes for&nbsp;<i>The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Vogue.</i><br><br> &nbsp;&#x201c;With its generous storytelling, lush photography and wood-fired cuisine, <i>Hartwood</i> is nearly as transporting as the open-air restaurant Eric Werner and Mya Henry run in the wilds of Mexico&#x2019;s Yucat�n Peninsula. Werner is the chef and does most of his cooking over fire, but here, he offers guidance on achieving similar effects at home for dishes like Grilled Lobster with Creamed Yuca. Tucked within the dreamy pages you&#x2019;ll find practical information, such as how to clean and season your grill and a step-by-step guide to grilling whole fish.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<i>Tasting Table</i><br><br> &#x201c;Not just some coffee-table restaurant cookbook. . . .

Long celebrated as a pathbreaking achievement in the social history of the ancient world, M.I. Finley's brilliant study remains, as classicist Bernard Knox notes in his introduction to this new edition, "as indispensable to the professional as it is accessible to the general reader"--a fundamental companion for students of Homer and Homeric Greece.</p><p><b>M. I. Finley</b> (1912-1986), the son of Nathan Finkelstein and Anna Katzellenbogen, was born in New York City. He graduated from Syracuse University at the age of fifteen and received an MA in public law from Columbia, before turning to the study of ancient history. During the thirties, Finley taught at Columbia and City College and developed an interest in the sociology of the ancient world that was shaped in part by his association with members of the Frankfurt School who were working in exile in America. In 1952, when he was teaching at Rutgers, Finley was summoned before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee and asked whether he had ever been a member of the Communist Party. He refused to answer, invoking the Fifth Amendment; by the end of the year he had been fired from the university by a unanimous vote of its trustees. Unable to find work in the US, Finley moved to England, where he taught for many years at Cambridge, helping to redirect the focus of classical education from a narrow emphasis on philology to a wider concern with culture, economics, and society. He became a British subject in 1962 and was knighted in 1979. Among Finley&#x2019;s best-known works are The&nbsp;<i>Ancient Economy, Ancient Slavery and Modern Ideology</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The World of Odysseus</i>.<br><br><b>Bernard Knox</b> (1914&#x2013;2010) was an English classicist. He was the first director of Harvard&#x2019;s Center for Hellenic Studies in Washington, DC. Among his many books are&nbsp;<i>The Heroic Temper, The Oldest Dead White European Males</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Backing into the Future: The Classical Tradition and Its Renewal</i>. He is the editor of&nbsp;<i>The Norton Book of Classical Literature</i>&nbsp;and wrote the introductions and notes for Robert Fagles&#x2019;s translations of the&nbsp;<i>Iliad</i>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<i>Odyssey</i>.</p><h2>What Is Poetry?: The Essential Guide to Reading and Writing Poems</h2><p><b>Celebrated poet and critic Michael Rosen takes readers on a whirlwind tour exploring what poems are, what they can do, and the joys of reading and writing them.</b><br><br>For thousands of years, people have been writing poetry. But what <i>is</i> poetry? Award-winning wordsmith Michael Rosen has spent decades thinking about that question, and in this helpful guide he shares his insights with humor, knowledge, and appreciation &#x2014; appreciation for poetry and appreciation for twenty-first-century children embarking on their own poetic journeys. Young readers are invited to join him on a welcoming exploration of the British poetic canon, replete with personal insights into what the renowned poet thinks about as he writes and advice on writing their own poetry. When he&#x2019;s finished, readers will be able to say with confidence: <i>this </i>is poetry<i>. </i>Included in this accessible handbook are writing tips, analyses of classic poems, and an appendix of poets and useful websites.</p><p><b>Michael Rosen</b> is one of the most popular contemporary poets and authors of books for children. He received the Eleanor Farjeon Award for services to children's literature in 1997 and served as Children's Laureate in the U.K. between 2007 and 2009. His books include the worldwide bestseller <i>We're Going on a Bear Hunt </i>and<i> </i>the award-winning <i>Michael Rosen's Sad Book </i>as well as <i>What&#x2019;s So Special About Shakespeare? </i>and <i>What&#x2019;s So Special About Dickens? </i>He lives in London.</p><h2>Survive the Unthinkable: A Total Guide to Women&#39;s Self-Protection</h2><p>Approximately 1.9 million women are physically assaulted annually in the United States alone. In <i>Survive the Unthinkable</i>, Tim Larkin empowers women to understand that surviving a potential attack isn't about being physically bigger, faster, or stronger; it's about knowing how to self-<i>protect</i>, not self-<i>defend. <br><br>Survive the Unthinkable </i>reveals the effective, proven principles behind Target Focus Training, the system Larkin has used to train Navy SEALs, celebrities, and soccer moms. It's a counter-intuitive mind / body approach women can use to protect themselves and their loved ones. Readers learn how to identify the difference between social aggression (which can be avoided) and asocial violence (which is unavoidable), recognize personal behaviors that may jeopardize safety, and target highly specific areas on an attacker's body for a strategic counterattack. <br><br>Larkin discusses how predators think and teaches women how to spot them, outsmart them, and stop them in their tracks. With principles proven to work regardless of size, strength, or athleticism, Larkin's approach revolutionizes women's perspective on violence and self-protection. Armed with the tools to neutralize any threat, readers will blast through the victim mindset and live freer, safer, more peaceful lives.</p><p>TIM LARKIN is a self-protection expert and author of <i>How to Survive the Most Critical 5 Seconds of Your Life</i>. He was named <i>Black Belt </i>magazine's 2011 Self-Defense Instructor of the Year. Over the last 20 years his company, Target Focus Training, has trained more than 48,000 people in more than 52 countries. He lives in Las Vegas.CHAPTER ONE<br><br>WHEN THE UNTHINKABLE HAPPENS<br><br>Life, in many ways, is like a game. We all live by a set of rules that govern sane, socialized behavior, and when we all play by these rules, people live happy lives in relative safety. These rules are, in essence, a set of agreements that we have with each other. For example, on the road we all agree to stop at red lights and drive on the right side of the painted line. When we fail to abide by these rules, people often get hurt or killed.<br><br>Most of us live according to age-old agreements about ethical behavior-- think of the Ten Commandments or the Golden Rule. All societies have remarkably similar ethical codes when it comes to civilized behavior. From a very early age, we are taught these rules until they become part of our social DNA.<br><br>The problem with this whole agreement scenario is that obviously, not everyone plays along. There are those among us who do not recognize or abide by the rules the rest of us acknowledge and respect. These individuals are predators. In some cases, predators have consciences, and in other cases, they do not. Asocial predators know how to capitalize on your desire to be a decent, ethical person so they can use it against you to get what they want.<br><br>THE FEMALE ADVANTAGE<br><br>As a woman, you have a special gift--an advantage, really--that many men do not. Most women, even at a very early age, are remarkably good at reading and interpreting the significance of nonverbal cues: body language, posture, gait, expression, grooming, clothing choices, and so on. By comparison, most men are almost comically inept when it comes to reading all but the most overt signals. Whereas men's ability to read nonverbal cues is essentially like a binary code--they either see it or they don't-- women are able to pick up on a rainbow of nuanced signals, as if they're seeing everything in full color while men are seeing in black-and-white.<br><br>Think of this set of typically female skills as a natural early warning mechanism (I often describe it as radar) that gives you precious moments to avoid violence instead of needing to deal with it on a physical level. My goal in this book is to make you aware of the many different types of potentially violent behavior.<br><br>Asocial violence is designed to be difficult to spot--which is why you need to trust and use your radar so you'll never end up in a dangerous situation. You don't want to live in a constant state of fear. But simply knowing that you have the tools to save your own life--and more specifically, that you have the power to use these tools--can dramatically impact your ability to survive a potentially violent encounter.<br><br>YOUR HISTORY AS PREY<br><br>There's a saying that wildlife biologists use to differentiate between predators and prey: "Eyes in the front--I like to hunt. Eyes on the side--I like to hide."<br><br>Your eyes aren't on the sides of your head. You're no soft bunny or squirming fish. Humans are designed as predators. That means you were also born with the tools to tap into this power to do damage to another human when necessary. You just have to give yourself permission to reconnect with these innate tools when the situation warrants it.<br><br>Throughout this book, I will share the many, many ways that you can make better choices that will steer you clear of dangerous situations, whether you're at the ATM, in a nightclub, or simply driving down the street. By far the best way to save your own life is to avoid putting it in danger in the first place--and I will show you dozens of ways to do just that.<br><br>But I also recognize that you probably have not come to this book as a blank slate--chances are that something bad has already happened to you. Whether it was physical violence, emotional abuse, or a shaky feeling that you narrowly escaped a creepy guy on a dark street, you may have had an experience that left a lasting mark on your psyche. By taking a look at your history, we'll examine how your prior run-ins with predators may have affected your self-image so you can work toward building your confidence and empowering yourself to live a safer, freer existence.<br><br>I'll introduce you to the very ugly world of violence, and the only thing that actually works against it--causing injury. Although unpleasant, it's imperative that I do so, because most of us are completely unfamiliar with this stark reality. Let me assure you, though: The moment you experience violence, you'll never ignore your instincts again--ever. Experiencing it (or even narrowly escaping it) is learning the hard way, and I hope that never happens to you.<br><br>The more I can show you about how a predator operates, the better you'll be at avoiding the deadly games they play.<br><br>ALWAYS TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS<br><br>Marta and her husband, Jeff, took a trip to Turkey. Both are highly educated and well traveled, and neither would strike you as a typical victim if you met them. In fact, Jeff is a big man--he stands six foot eight and has the physique of an NFL linebacker. Their guide warned them about walking around Ankara by themselves, but the city seemed completely safe, with lots of American tourists.<br><br>After about an hour of relaxed sightseeing, Jeff spotted a local bazaar that another tourist had mentioned to him the previous day. They decided to have a look, and after buying a few souvenirs, they sat down to have some Turkish coffee. As they rested up from their long walk, the couple savored the many sights and sounds, snapping pictures of the various food vendors and enjoying snacks with their coffee.<br><br>Before long, two local men at the next table started up a conversation with Jeff. They expressed their fondness for the American tourists they had met, and relief that the Americans they'd met didn't seem to be prejudiced against Muslims, despite what local news programs were saying. Both men were charming, well dressed, and seemingly sincere. Still, although Marta couldn't put her finger on why, her instincts told her something wasn't right.<br><br>After ten or fifteen minutes of conversation, one of the men offered them some small cookies that looked similar to Oreos. "These cakes are famous in Ankara--people travel many miles just to taste these--you must try them!" one of the men insisted.<br><br>Marta's instincts screamed, "Don't eat them!" but her desire to be polite overpowered her inner radar. Marta and Jeff each ate a few cookies, which were laced with an unknown drug. The only thing that saved them was the fact that Jeff's size meant the drug didn't have a significant effect on him. He managed to fend off the two men, although he was injured in the process.<br><br>These two predators knew exactly how to manipulate social conventions. They built up a lot of social goodwill before they attacked. And Marta and Jeff ignored their instincts and assumed everyone around them was playing by the same social rules. Asocial violence uses these rules against you. As Marta recounted this nightmare scenario to me, I could sense that she would never ignore her instincts again. It could have been worse for Marta and Jeff, but they got lucky (and I never suggest betting your life on luck!).<br><br>MYTHS ABOUT RAPE<br><br>Rape is a violent crime that is greatly misunderstood in our society. Our society harbors certain myths about rape that make it difficult for women to understand these crimes, let alone report them. The blame-the-victim stigma not only prevents women from seeking help, but also perpetuates myths that get women killed. Let's set a few to rest.<br><br>MYTH: Rape is a sexual act.<br><br>TRUTH: Rape is an act of brutal violence that has nothing to do with sex. Rape is all about power and domination and aggression. Instead of equating rape with "rough sex," think of it as being like a stabbing or a shooting. The rapist uses his penis as a weapon, just like a gun or a knife. That definitely is not sex.<br><br>MYTH: Most rapes are committed by strangers in dark alleys.<br><br>TRUTH: Four out of five rapes are committed by people the victims know.<br><br>MYTH: "Date rape" isn't "real" rape.<br><br>TRUTH: Rape is rape. Anytime a woman is forced or coerced against her will into having sex with someone, whether she just met him, has kissed him, or even married him, that is rape.<br><br>MYTH: Women get over rape pretty quickly.<br><br>TRUTH: Women can suffer physical and emotional trauma for years, even decades, after being raped.<br><br>MYTH: The only rape that "counts" is intercourse.<br><br>TRUTH: Women can be raped or sexually assaulted in dozens of sickening ways.<br><br>MYTH: Rape is not very common.<br><br>TRUTH: One woman in six will be raped in her lifetime; one in four female college students will experience a rape or attempted rape while in school.<br><br>Myth: When women get drunk or wear slutty clothes, they are asking to get raped.<br><br>TRUTH: Nothing a woman does, wears, says, or even thinks makes it okay to rape her. "No" means "no"--in every setting, in every relationship, in every encounter. Anyone who rapes a woman is a rapist, whether he's a thug with a knife in an alleyway, a frat boy with a beer bong and a roofie, or a husband who gets forceful because he thinks his wife "owes" him sex.<br><br>Forget the excuses. There are no valid reasons. Rape is rape.<br><br>NEVER ASSUME ANYTHING<br><br>In my training classes, I always play a particular YouTube video as an example of what asocial violence looks like. In this video, a highly trained female police officer has pulled over a man who has multiple outstanding warrants for felony offenses. The man's young daughter sits in the passenger seat, and so the officer doesn't pull out her gun. In turn, she assumes that the girl's presence will prevent the felon from becoming violent. In essence, the officer thought she had an unspoken social agreement with this man.<br><br>She was very wrong. In full view of his terrified daughter, the felon methodically beats the officer by throwing her to the ground and punching her nine times in the head. In the video, the commentator states that keeping a safe distance gives you more time to react to aggression. The officer was trained in what to do, but her social conditioning led her to believe that people don't attack other people in front of children, and that took precedence over her training. She could have handled the stop safely and effectively, but she allowed her sense of social decency to override her extensive police training.<br><br>This violent criminal probably assumed the officer would "play by the rules" and used that knowledge against her. If the felon had been alone, I'd bet anything that that day would have gone down much differently.<br><br>Think you'll pay attention to your instincts the next time your radar goes off? If so, just remember that this highly trained police officer knew she was dealing with a desperate, dangerous felon, and yet she still fell prey to thinking that because the felon's young daughter was present, he would be cooperative. She was quite mistaken, and she could have been killed because of it.<br><br>DON'T BE AFRAID TO ACT<br><br>Catherine entered the ground floor of a four-story parking lot with two friends. Their cars were parked on the first floor; hers was on the third. As they walked in, she noticed a guy who appeared to be watching them by the garage entrance. He was well dressed, but there was something creepy about him: The hair on the back of her neck stood up, her adrenaline surged, her heart rate increased, and she got a queasy feeling in her stomach. She considered asking one of her friends to walk her to her car, but then felt silly and gave the guy the benefit of the doubt. The creepy feeling faded as she justified heading to the elevator alone. "He's all the way over by the entrance. He's nowhere near me."<br><br>She got in, pushed "3," and when the door opened on her floor, the creepy guy was right there, his body inches from hers, blocking her from fleeing the elevator. For a moment she stood paralyzed, and he lunged at her. This guy wanted something--who knows what. It doesn't matter; it wasn't right. When he lunged, there was no time to ask questions.<br><br>Fortunately, Catherine had taken one of my Target Focus Training classes. Her training kicked in and she took action. She immediately identified a target on the guy (his groin) and a weapon in her own hand (her briefcase). In one fluid motion she stepped forward and smashed the briefcase with all her force into the guy's groin. He moved exactly as she had learned in class he would: He bent forward in agony, reflexively raising his chin. That involuntary reflex provided Catherine with a second target: She slammed all her body weight into his temple using a hammer fist (the balled- up pinky side). The combined force of her weight and the impact with the elevator door knocked this guy out. She had injured him twice even though he was much bigger and stronger than she was. His size hadn't mattered--her targeting had. With the guy out cold, Catherine felt safe enough to run and call security.<br><br>In an interesting twist, by the time security arrived, the guy was gone. He wasn't sitting there, nursing his injuries. So we can't know for certain what his intentions were--he never had to explain himself. Was it all a misunderstanding? We'll never know.<br><br>Catherine's immediate feeling was "Thank god I acted." Her husband had signed her up for my class, and she admits she'd never have come on her own. As with you, or any of us for that matter, violence was not something she wanted to dwell on. It was something that might happen to other people, not to her. But without training, her story might have had a very ugly ending.<br><br>Later she began questioning herself. Why hadn't she trusted her instincts, the nonverbal cues her body was giving her--the hair rising on the back of her neck, the queasy feeling that something was absolutely wrong--the moment she'd spotted the guy? Why had she put herself in danger?<br><br>Now, the question you must ask yourself is What would I have done?<br><br>AVOIDING VIOLENCE AT ALL COSTS<br><br>The three stories I've shared in this chapter have different details and somewhat varied outcomes, but they all share a very important theme: In each case, an otherwise smart, capable woman placed herself in unnecessary peril because she squelched her innate survival instincts in deference to her strong desire to "follow the rules" of a sane, civilized society.</p><h2>The Floating Feldmans</h2><p><b>A family vacation dredges up a boatload of trouble in the next witty, insightful novel from the acclaimed author of <i>The Intermission</i>.</b><br><br><b>"An irresistible drama filled with humor and heart-tugging emotion about family and what it means to belong.

Then a series of gasps. Finally, from somewhere deep in the room, came a chorus of &#x201c;Fight, fight, fight!&#x201d; The chant quickly grew in volume, and suddenly it seemed like everyone was shouting for blood.</p><p>&#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen, may I please have your attention!&#x201d; Julian Masterino attempted to calm the chaos for a third time, but he was no match for the angry rabble. From his perch on the bandstand, they looked like a swarm of flies, circling and buzzing in a cacophonous roar. Normally Julian&#x2019;s uniform, a fitted white sailor&#x2019;s jumper and his ever-present megaphone, was enough to will a hush over a rambunctious crowd. But tonight, in a black tuxedo, he blended in with everyone else on the ship. To make matters worse, the volume lever on his megaphone was broken. Meanwhile, babies wailed in high chairs, the elderly guests whined from motorized scooters, and the able-bodied adults dashed about in their formal wear vying for a better look at the crime scene. The leader of the barbershop quartet, the evening&#x2019;s opening act, gazed desperately at Julian from under his bowler hat and plucked a few helpless chords in C on his banjo. Julian gave him the universal symbol for &#x201c;not now,&#x201d; a quick slash to the neck, and he quieted down.</p><p>The paramedic team skidded onto the dance floor, propelled into the scrum of people by the weight of equipment they probably wouldn&#x2019;t need. To Julian&#x2019;s practiced eye, the two gentlemen who had, moments earlier, been throwing punches at each other were not the sort of people for whom violence was a preferred method of conflict resolution. They were amateurs at best&#x2014;and the injuries they had sustained were undoubtedly more to their psyches than physical. Still, the older guy was on the ground, blood running from his nose. It was time to clear the room.</p><p>But how could it be done? Julian was a seasoned pro, but even he had never tried a last-minute relocation of three thousand hungry diners. Short of an iceberg, he&#x2019;d never envisioned a scenario that would require such a thing. And now, faced with a ship full of guests determined to ignore his instructions, there weren&#x2019;t a lot of good options left. Julian could think of only one surefire way to regain command of his people. Throwing caution to the wind, he reached for his megaphone and pressed firmly on the talk button.</p><p>&#x201c;Attention, all guests aboard the Ocean Queen. The main buffet and all-night ice cream bar on the Starboard Deck will be closed until further notice.&#x201d;</p><p>A shocked hush immediately dropped over the crowd, and Julian smiled to himself.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not fair,&#x201d; complained an anguished mother of three. &#x201c;My kids are still hungry!&#x201d;</p><p>Hungry? On average, passengers aboard the Ocean Queen consumed six thousand calories per day, sitting down to no less than five full meals. The midmorning &#x201c;snack&#x201d; consisted of pastries, a full salad bar, and a taco station. Afternoon tea was the least dainty meal Julian had ever laid eyes on. Instead of finger sandwiches and bite-size lemon tarts, the kitchen staff put out twelve-foot loaves of streusel from which the guests could hack off as much as they liked. And, as far as Julian could tell, they liked a lot of streusel.</p><p>&#x201c;This is an all-inclusive ship,&#x201d; barked a burly fellow who stood to the left of the bandstand. He had accessorized his tuxedo with a bolo tie and cowboy hat and was already working his way through a plate piled high with meat. &#x201c;And we all know you save the best food for the formal night!&#x201d;</p><p>Julian was prepared to promise an impromptu chocolate fountain and make-your-own-sushi opportunity, if only everyone would exit in an orderly fashion. But before he could position his megaphone, an attractive older woman stood up and addressed the crowd. She had been crouching on the floor, tending to the more senior of the two bloodied combatants&#x2014;the sad-faced man who was now cradling his knee. Julian couldn&#x2019;t help but admire the way the woman presented herself: She wore a beautiful blue satin gown that stretched forgivingly across her wide hips and her hair was swept into a precise chignon.</p><p>&#x201c;What is wrong with you people?&#x201d; she shouted, her voice impressive and thunderous. &#x201c;From the minute you woke up this morning, you&#x2019;ve been stuffing your faces, pushing and shoving in the buffet lines like you&#x2019;ve never seen a croissant before. Get a grip on yourselves. My husband was just punched in the face by my son-in-law, who has apparently hated our family for the past twenty years.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not true,&#x201d; said the other erstwhile combatant in a breathy voice as he was lifted onto a stretcher by the paramedics. This second, younger man was obviously the bitter son-in-law. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you guys&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. acting juvenile&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You do not need to defend yourself!&#x201d; belted a younger woman in a pink dress who stood beside the man&#x2019;s stretcher. She stared daggers at the ballsy lady in the blue satin and said, &#x201c;Mitch has nothing to apologize for, Mother.&#x201d;</p><p>Holy hell. A dueling mother-daughter ensemble was certainly not needed on the night that was meant to be the crescendo of the trip, the black-tie party known as An Enchanted Evening, which would set the tone for how generous the guests would be when parceling out gratuities. And if they weren&#x2019;t opening their wallets widely, Julian would be hearing about it from everyone on the staff, from the lifeguards down to the porters, the whole crew blaming him for not keeping the guests happy.</p><p>&#x201c;Everyone, listen to the cruise director, and get off of this deck now,&#x201d; yelled the mother. Then the daughter chimed in: &#x201c;You will be fed. You will have your formal night. You will be &#x2018;enchanted,&#x2019; for heaven&#x2019;s sake. Just let the doctors attend to my husband in peace.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mom? Elise? What the hell is going on?&#x201d; asked a middle-aged man as he pushed through the crowd. The newcomer had graying hair tied in a bun, and, as Julian couldn&#x2019;t help noticing, his outfit did not conform to the night&#x2019;s dress code requirement. He was tugging on the hand of a human Barbie doll teetering along in four-inch heels. Julian blinked twice. This overly made-up girl wearing a dress that could have doubled as an Ace bandage was none other than the amazing yogini he&#x2019;d met in Ashtanga class earlier that day.</p><p>A picture was forming in Julian&#x2019;s mind. This was the Feldman family. He vaguely remembered chatting with them at the around-the-world dinner the night before, and he&#x2019;d seen the daughter&#x2014;her name was Elise&#x2014;just hours earlier in the coffee shop. They were all on board to celebrate a big birthday. If memory served him correctly, they were vacationing together in honor of the matriarch in blue.</p><p>Julian hated to see things like this happen on one of his trips, and not just because it meant reduced gratuities and filing extra paperwork with the corporate office. It truly broke his heart when a family with grand plans to bond and share quality time was reduced to blows and name-calling. This wasn&#x2019;t the first time it had happened. And it wouldn&#x2019;t be the last. Maybe it was the fact that passengers on cruise vacations were sequestered from the outside world&#x2014;and that submerged feelings were bound to surface whenever people volunteered to isolate themselves. Or maybe it was the consistent low-level nausea they experienced at sea that activated bad behavior. Julian had one theory, originally espoused by the ship&#x2019;s previous captain, that involved those motion sickness patches everyone stuck behind their ears: He posited that they actually worked like hearing aids, amplifying all the irritations that normally went unnoticed.</p><p>Julian&#x2019;s assistant, Lindsay, approached him from behind and whispered something in his ear. He smiled, knowing the immediate crisis had been solved.</p><p>&#x201c;Attention, all passengers,&#x201d; Julian said, clearing his throat for emphasis and raising his megaphone once again. &#x201c;A free drink will be provided to all guests who relocate to the Mariposa Ballroom on the Discovery Deck.&#x201d;</p><p>It was like shouting &#x201c;fire&#x201d; in a crowded room. The adults grabbed their children by the wrists, gave their elder counterparts a firm push at the back of their wheelchairs, and set out dutifully to secure their complimentary cocktail. The Ocean Queen was an all-inclusive ship when it came to food and most onboard activities, but alcohol was strictly pay-to-play.</p><p>Once the room was cleared of everyone except himself, the Feldmans, and a few overzealous paramedics, it was terribly quiet.</p><p>&#x201c;Is there anything I can do?&#x201d; Julian asked. He approached the family cautiously, stationing himself directly in between the two stretchers. His role in these situations could vary greatly. He could be anything from therapist to ice pack bearer, arbitrator, or bouncer. Sometimes all he needed was to present a voucher for a complimentary land excursion, and the entire family was able to put aside their squabbling in deference to the freebie.</p><p>It was hard to read the Feldmans, though. The older woman was tough. He could tell from her rant. The daughter, Elise, was just as voluble but far less confident&#x2014;she fell a little more on the hysterical side of the spectrum. The rest of the family? Julian couldn&#x2019;t make heads or tails of the dynamic there.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re sorry for the trouble,&#x201d; the elder Mrs. Feldman said to Julian, looking mortified as she tended to her husband&#x2019;s busted nose.</p><p>&#x201c;You and Dad started it,&#x201d; Elise snapped.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s not worry about blame now,&#x201d; Julian said. &#x201c;I just want to make sure everyone is feeling well enough to enjoy the remainder of the trip.&#x201d; And that I don&#x2019;t need to throw anyone in the brig, he thought to himself.</p><p>The teenage girl bent over Mitch on stretcher #2, and Julian was relieved to see signs of life in her vacant face.</p><p>&#x201c;Sweetie,&#x201d; Mitch said, rolling with great effort onto his side to access the wallet in his pocket. &#x201c;Take a few twenties and go with your brother to the arcade.&#x201d;</p><p>The girl started combing through a wad of bills.</p><p>&#x201c;No! No money!&#x201d; Elise roared, grabbing the wallet away from her. &#x201c;We have no money to spare. Zero. And honestly, Rachel, your father probably dislocated his shoulder and is clearly in agony. Your grandfather is also in serious pain. How can you be so selfish?&#x201d;</p><p>Man-Bun stepped forward gallantly.</p><p>&#x201c;Rachel, here&#x2019;s two hundred. Take Darius and go.&#x201d; The blonde on stilts looked at him like he was Jesus and Mother Teresa rolled into one.</p><p>&#x201c;Take it, Rachel,&#x201d; the grandfather said firmly from stretcher #1. &#x201c;You kids need to clear out of here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Over my dead body!&#x201d; said Elise. &#x201c;No one wants your drug money, Freddy!&#x201d;</p><p>Drug money? Julian stared at Freddy, imagining bags of cocaine hidden all over the ship. He felt a prickle of nervous sweat beginning to form at his hairline and debated asking one of the paramedics to take his blood pressure. But no, he needed to stay in command.</p><p>Who was this family? The Ocean Queen regularly attracted a motley crew, but its passengers&#x2019; foibles were, for the most part, the extremely visible kind. Like with the BDSMers&#x2014;everyone basically knew who they were, especially Housekeeping, who had to step over the gags and harnesses on the cabin floor every morning. The Feldmans, on the other hand, were outfitted like schoolteachers chaperoning the prom. All except Freddy, but that didn&#x2019;t make him any less of an enigma. He had an aging Jimmy Buffett sort of vibe; he looked far more like a goofy beer snob with a trophy girlfriend than a drug dealer.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s not get excited again,&#x201d; Julian said, slipping into the therapist role. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t we let the paramedics finish their job, and then I&#x2019;m sure you can all calmly discuss everything in a more intimate setting. I&#x2019;d be happy to offer you one of our private dining rooms&#x2014;we can set up a cheese plate and a few bottles of good burgundy, absolutely free of charge.&#x201d; Julian couldn&#x2019;t have these crazy people airing their (potentially criminal) dirty laundry all over the Ocean Queen. He&#x2019;d get crushed on TripAdvisor.</p><p>&#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s probably best if you just leave us alone now,&#x201d; said Freddy&#x2019;s too-young girlfriend. As the words left the girl&#x2019;s pillow lips, Elise&#x2019;s face contorted in rage.</p><p>&#x201c;And I think that you don&#x2019;t get to have an opinion,&#x201d; Elise shouted at the younger woman. &#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t even a member of this family!&#x201d;</p><p>Julian could tell that, for Mrs. Feldman, this exchange was the last straw. She stepped in between Freddy and Elise, who were obviously about to go a few rounds themselves, and said, &#x201c;Everyone: Cut it out. This is my birthday celebration. We will all get along for the next twenty-four hours or else.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Feldman hadn&#x2019;t actually raised her voice during this little speech, but the intensity of feeling behind her words was clear. A seam in her blue gown had ripped from the sheer force of her heaving bosom.</p><p>Julian took a sudden step back. Shouting, blood, threats, raised fists. It wasn&#x2019;t what he&#x2019;d call a successful night aboard ship. And he&#x2019;d done all he could to simmer things down. If free food and alcohol couldn&#x2019;t help the Feldman clan, they were perhaps beyond repair. He quietly slipped out of the room and headed toward his own cabin on the staff floor, which was below sea level, leaving the warring family members on deck to berate each other until sunrise.</p><p>Boat life was a matter of simple rinse and repeat. Eat, argue, bingo. Eat, argue, show. Eat, argue, excursion. And then eat some more. If he didn&#x2019;t see the Feldmans at breakfast the next morning&#x2014;if the feud was enough to overtake their appetites&#x2014;he&#x2019;d know they were in real trouble.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Part I</p><p>The Call</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>Chapter One</p><p>When the call came for Elise Feldman Connelly, she was in Costco.</p><p>Elise&#x2014;mother, wife, friend, shopper&#x2014;eyed the checkout lines from her spot in the outdoor furniture aisle, which were growing even longer as she studied them. She hated queuing in stores, all that extra time to ponder the contents of her cart with the twin forces of desire and guilt. She should know better than to go to Costco on a Sunday, when the lines were always eternal. Maybe she&#x2019;d put her cart aside, ask her favorite store manager, Jeff, to watch her stuff, and then return tomorrow when she could swipe and dash. But no, then the thrill would be gone.</p><p>How Elise craved that soaring spike in adrenaline that shot pins and needles to her extremities and sent butterflies to her stomach. She sighed and looked back at her cart, fighting off the urge to calculate. The total couldn&#x2019;t be much. She had tossed in maybe eight or nine hardcovers at most, three frozen cakes, a few packages of T-shirts for Darius, and a bunch of sports bras she&#x2019;d need now that she&#x2019;d signed up for ClassPass. Underneath, reading glasses, an electric screwdriver, a terry cloth robe, rubber flip-flops for the whole family (they appeared to run small so she&#x2019;d chosen two sizes for everyone), new cutting boards, a set of knives, a Magic Bullet, a yoga mat, a George Foreman that looked more advanced than her current George Foreman, and a delicate fourteen-karat gold necklace for Rachel. Plus the faux ficus tree that was being held for her at the register.</p><p>&#x201c;Elis...</p></p><h2>How to Teach Your Baby Math (The Gentle Revolution Series)</h2><p><p>Time and again, the work performed at The Institutes for&nbsp;the Achievement of Human Potential has demonstrated that children from birth to age six are capable of learning better and faster than older children. <i>How To Teach Your Baby To Read </i>shows just how easy it is to teach a young child to read, while <i>How To Teach Your Baby Math </i>presents the simple steps for teaching mathematics through the development of thinking and reasoning skills. Both books explain how to begin and expand each program, how to make and organize necessary materials, and how to more fully develop your child&#x2019;s reading and math potential.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>How to Give Your Baby Encyclopedic Knowledge </i>shows how simple it is to develop a program that cultivates a young child&#x2019;s awareness and understanding of the arts, science, and nature&#x2015;to recognize the insects in the garden, to learn about the countries of the world, to discover the beauty of a Van Gogh painting, and much more. <i>How To Multiply Your Baby&#x2019;s Intelligence </i>provides a comprehensive program for teaching your young child how to read, to understand mathematics, and to literally multiply his or her overall learning potential in preparation for a lifetime of success.</p> <p>The Gentle Revolution Series:</p> <p>The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential has been successfully serving children and teaching parents for five decades. Its goal has been to significantly improve the intellectual, physical, and social development of all children. The groundbreaking methods and techniques of The Institutes have set the standards in early childhood education. As a result, the books written by Glenn Doman, founder of this organization, have become the all-time best-selling parenting series in the United States and the world.</p></p><p><i> </i><p><i>Glenn Doman </i>received his degree in physical therapy from the University of Pennsylvania in 1940. From that point on, he began pioneering the field&nbsp;of child brain development. In 1955, he founded The Institutes' world-renowned work with brain-injured children had led to vital discoveries regarding the growth and development of well children. The author has lived with, studied, and worked with children in more than one hundred nations, ranging from the most civilized to the most primitive. Doman is also the international best-selling author of six books, all part of the Gentle Revolution Series, including <i>How To Teach Yor Baby To Read, How To Teach Your Baby Math,</i> and <i>How To Give Your Baby Encyclopedic Knowledge.</i> </p><br><br><i> </i><p><i>Janet Doman </i>is the director of The Institutes and Glenn&#x2019;s daughter. She was actively involved in helping brain-injured children by the time she was nine years old, and after completing her studies at the University of Pennsylvania, devoted herself to helping parents discover the vast potential of their babies and their own potential as teachers.</p><p>Introduction</p> <p>Dear Parents,</p> <p>Very few people buy a book for the purpose of disagreeing with it.</p> <p>The fact that you&#x2019;ve bought this book means that, no matter how improbable the title sounds, you&#x2019;ve got a healthy suspicion that it is possible to teach your baby how to do math, and in that suspicion you are entirely correct.</p> <p>Indeed you can, and with a degree of success that even you as parents could not have dreamed to be possible.</p> <p>It will help you to understand how simply this can be done as well as how incredibly far you can take your baby in math, and the great joy that you and your baby will know in doing it, if you understand the way in which it all came about.</p> <p>The staff of The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential have had a glorious love affair going with mothers for the last thirty-fi ve years. As the director of The Institutes, I must say it has been a great affair, altogether rewarding and fulfilling.</p> <p>The affair began poorly and was actually forced upon both the parents and us as a sort of blind date. Mutual trust was low and suspicion was high. It would never have happened in the fi rst place if it hadn&#x2019;t been for the hurt kids and their staggering needs. It was their need that forced parents and us into each other&#x2019;s arms.</p> <p>In the 1940s the parents of severely brain-injured children had no reason to be grateful to professional people and little reason to trust them. In those days the professional people believed that merely to talk of making a brain-injured child well was not only the worst kind of foolishness but that to do so, even as an objective, was somehow deeply immoral. Many professional people still so believe.</p> <p>We, as professional people who were daily con- fronted with children who were paralyzed, speech- less, blind, deaf, incontinent, and who were universally considered to be hopelessly &#x201c;mentally retarded,&#x201d; harbored deep suspicion of parents. Even our own early group that was to become the staff of The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential began with the unspoken but common professional belief that &#x201c;all mothers are idiots and that they have no truth in them.&#x201d; This myth, which is still prevalent, has the tragic result that nobody talks to mothers, and the good Lord knows that nobody listens to them.</p> <p>Beginning with that belief, as we did, it took us several years to learn that mothers, closely followed by fathers, know more about their own children than anybody else alive.</p> <p>Myths die hard and the process of unlearning is a great deal harder than the process of learning, and for some people, unlearning is simply impossible. It is frightening for me to admit that if the staggering needs of the brain-injured children hadn&#x2019;t forced us into daily nose-to-nose contact with their parents, we would never have learned the truly extraordinary love that parents have for their children, the profound depth of appreciation they have for their children&#x2019;s potential abilities, and the seemingly miraculous accomplishments they can make possible for their children when they understand the very practical way in which the human brain works.</p> <p>Suspicion dies slowly and true love must be earned. Often, necessity is not only the mother of invention but also the basis for the beginning of love and understanding if neither party can afford the luxury of running away.</p> <p>Since the brain-injured children needed help desperately, we and the parents were forced into each other&#x2019;s arms in a marriage not merely of convenience but of necessity.</p> <p>If the hurt children were to have any sort of life worth living it quickly became apparent that both we and their parents were going to have to devote every moment of our lives to bringing this about.</p> <p>And so we did.</p> <p>Beginning a project in clinical research is like getting on a train about which we know little. It&#x2019;s a venture full of mystery and excitement, for you do not know whether you&#x2019;ll have a compartment to yourself or be going second class, whether the train has a dining car or not, what the trip will cost or whether you will end up where you had hoped to go or in a foreign place you never dreamed of visiting.</p> <p>When our team members got on this train at the various stations, we were hoping that our destination was better treatment for severely brain-injured children. None of us dreamed that if we achieved this goal we would stay on the train till we reached a place where brain-injured children might even be made superior to unhurt children.</p> <p>The trip has thus far taken thirty-fi ve years, the accommodation was second class, and the dining car served mostly sandwiches, night after night, often at three in the morning. The tickets cost all we had, some of us did not live long enough to fi nish the trip&#x2015;and none of us would have missed it for anything else the world has to offer. It&#x2019;s been a fascinating trip.</p> <p>The original passenger list included a brain surgeon, a physiatrist (an M.D. who specializes in physical medicine and rehabilitation), a physical therapist, a speech therapist, a psychologist, an educator and a nurse. Now there are more than a hundred of us all told, with many additional kinds of specialists.</p> <p>The little team was formed originally because each of us was individually charged with some phase of the treatment of severely brain-injured children&#x2015;and each of us individually was failing.</p> <p>If you are going to choose a creative field in which to work, it is difficult to pick one with more room for improvement than one in which failure has been 100 percent and success is nonexistent.</p> <p>When we began our work together thirty-five years ago we had never seen or heard of a single brain-injured child who had ever gotten well.</p> <p>The group that formed after our individual failures would today be called a rehabilitation team. In those days so long ago neither of those words was fashionable and we looked upon ourselves as nothing as grand as all that. Perhaps we saw ourselves more pathetically and more clearly as a group who had banded together, much as a convoy does, hoping that we would be stronger together than we had proved to be separately.</p> <p>We discovered that it mattered very little (except from a research point of view) whether a child had incurred his injury prenatally, at the instant of birth or post natally. This was rather like being concerned about whether a child had been hit by an automobile before noon, at noon or after noon. What really mattered was which part of his brain had been hurt, how much it had been hurt, and what might be done about it.</p> <p>We discovered further that it mattered very little whether a child&#x2019;s good brain had been hurt because his parents had incompatible Rh factors, because his mother had an infectious disease such as German measles during the first three months of pregnancy, because there had been an insufficiency of oxygen reaching his brain during the prenatal period, or because he had been born prematurely. The brain can also be hurt as a result of protracted labor, of a fall on the head which causes blood clots on the brain, of a high temperature with encephalitis, of being struck by an automobile, or of a hundred other factors.</p> <p>Again, while this was significant from the research point of view, it was rather like worrying about whether a particular child had been hit by a car or a hammer. The important thing here was which part of the child&#x2019;s brain was hurt, how much it was hurt, and what we were going to do about it.</p> <p>In those early days, the world that dealt with brain-injured children held the view that the problems of these children might be solved by treating the symptoms that existed in the ears, eyes, nose, mouth, chest, shoulders, elbows, wrists, fingers, hips, knees, ankles and toes. A large portion of the world still believes this today.</p> <p>Such an approach did not work then and could not possibly ever work.</p> <p>Because of this total lack of success, we concluded that if we were to solve the multiple symptoms of the brain-injured child we would have to attack the source of the problem and approach the human brain itself.</p> <p>While at first this seemed an impossible or at least monumental task, in the years that followed, we and others found both surgical and nonsurgical methods of treating the brain.</p> <p>First we tackled the problem from a nonsurgical standpoint. In the years that followed, we became persuaded that if we could not hope to succeed with the dead brain cells, we would have to find ways to reproduce in some manner the neurological growth-patterns of a normal child. This meant understanding how a normal child&#x2019;s brain begins, grows and matures. We studied intently many hundreds of normal newborn babies, infants and children.</p> <p>As we learned what normal brain growth is and means, we began to find that the simple and long- known basic activities of normal children, such as crawling and creeping, are of the greatest possible importance to the brain. We learned that if such activities are denied to normal children, because of cultural, environmental or social factors, the potential of these children is severely limited. The potential of brain-injured children is even more affected.</p> <p>As we learned more about ways to reproduce this normal physical pattern of growing up we began to see brain-injured children improve&#x2015;very, very slightly.</p> <p>It was about this time, after working for several years with the parents, that our mutual suspicions disappeared. Love and trust were dawning. So thoroughly had we begun to trust our parents&#x2019; love and innate good sense that we stopped treating the children ourselves and taught the parents all we had learned about the brain, laid out programs for the children, and sent the parents home to carry them out. Results got better, rather than declining. Our respect for parents rose considerably.</p> <p>It was also at about this time that the neuro-surgical components of our team began to prove conclusively that the answer lay in the brain itself, by developing successful surgical approaches to it.</p> <p>A single startling method will serve as an example of the many types of successful brain surgery which are in use today to solve the problems of the brain-injured child.</p> <p>There are actually two brains, a right brain and a left brain. These two brains are divided right down the middle of the head from front to rear. In well human beings the right brain (or, if you like, the right half of the brain) is responsible for controlling the left side of the body, while the left half of the brain is responsible for running the right side.</p> <p>If one half of the brain is hurt to any large degree, the results are catastrophic. The opposite side of the body will be paralyzed, and the child will be severely restricted in all functions. Many such children have constant and severe convulsive seizures that do not respond to any known medication.</p> <p>It need hardly be said that such children also die. The ancient cry of those who stood for doing nothing had been chanted over and over for decades. That cry was that when a brain cell was dead it was dead and nothing could be done for children with dead brain cells, so don&#x2019;t try. But by 1955 the neurosurgical members of our group were performing an almost unbelievable kind of surgery on such children; it is called hemispherectomy.</p> <p>Hemispherectomy is precisely what that name implies&#x2015;the surgical removal of half the human brain.</p> <p>Now we saw children with half a brain in the head and with the other half, billions of brain cells, in a jar at the hospital&#x2015;dead and gone. But the children were not dead.</p> <p>Instead we saw children with only half a brain who walked, talked and went to school like other children. Several such children were above average, and at least one of them had an l.Q. in the genius area.</p> <p>It was now obvious that if one half of a child&#x2019;s brain was seriously hurt, it mattered little how good the other half was as long as the hurt half remained. If, for example, such a child was suffering convulsions caused by the injured left brain, he would be unable to demonstrate his intelligence until that half was removed in order to let the intact right brain take over the entire function without interference.</p> <p>We had long held that, contrary to popular belief, a child might have ten dead brain cells and we would not even know it. Perhaps, we said, he might have a hundred dead brain cells and we would not be aware of it. Perhaps, we said, even a thousand.</p> <p>Not in our wildest dreams had we dared to believe that a child might have billions of dead brain cells and yet perform almost as well as and sometimes even better than an average child.</p> <p>Now the reader must join us in a speculation. How long could we look at Johnny, who had half his brain removed, and see him perform as well as Billy, who had an intact brain, without asking the question, What is wrong with Billy? Why did not Billy, who had twice as much brain as Johnny, perform twice as well or at least better?</p> <p>Having seen this happen over and over again, we began to look with new and questioning eyes at average children.</p> <p>Were average children doing as well as they might?</p> <p>Here was an important question we had never dreamed of asking.</p> <p>In the meantime, the nonsurgical elements of the team had acquired a great deal more knowledge of how such children grow and how their brains develop. As our knowledge of normality increased, our simple methods for reproducing that normality in brain-injured children kept pace. By now we were beginning to see a small number of brain-injured children reach normality by the use of the simple nonsurgical methods of treatment which were steadily evolving and improving.</p> <p>It is not the purpose of this book to detail either the concepts or the methods used to solve the multiple problems of brain-injured children. Other books, already published or at present in manuscript form, deal with the treatment of the brain-injured child. However, that such problems are being solved daily is of significance in understanding the pathway that led to the knowledge that normal children can perform infi nitely better than they are doing at present. It is sufficient to say that extremely simple techniques were devised to reproduce in brain-injured children the patterns of normal development.</p> <p>As an example, when a brain-injured child is unable to move correctly he is simply taken in an orderly progression through the stages of growth which occur in normal children. First he is helped to move his arms and legs, then to crawl, then to creep, then finally to walk. He is physically aided in doing these things in a patterned sequence. He progresses through these ever higher stages in the same manner as a child does in the grades at school and is given unlimited opportunity to utilize these activities.</p> <p>A program of this kind having been initiated, we soon began to see severely brain-injured children whose performance rivaled that of children who had not suffered a brain injury. And as the techniques improved even more, we began to see brain-injured children emerge who could not only perform as well as average children but, indeed, who could not be distinguished from them.</p> <p>As our understanding of ne...</p></p><h2>Francis and Eddie: The True Story of America&#39;s Underdogs</h2><p><p>A century ago, in 1913, the world's finest golfers gathered at The Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts, to compete in golf's national championship, the U.S. Open. Joining them was a little-known amateur, 20-year-old Francis Ouimet, who lived across the street from the course and taught himself to play by sneaking onto the fairways with the only golf club he owned. His caddie? Ten-year-old Eddie Lowery, who stood only four feet tall. Together, against their idols and in front of a crowd that grew from a handful of spectators to a horde of thousands, they attempted to pull off the impossible. Along the way, they forged a lifelong friendship. In FRANCIS AND EDDIE award-winning author Brad Herzog and award-winning illustrator Zachary Pullen celebrate golf's most inspiring underdog story.

Why a ninety-day guide? It takes that long for sperm to mature, and at least that much time for the prospective mother to ensure that her body becomes pregnancy-ready. In a warm, intelligent style, the authors address up-to-date topics such as age, heredity, vaccinations, supplements, and weight. In easily accessible chapters, this guide covers such topics as<br> &nbsp;<br> � <b>Nutrition:</b> meal makeovers plus new facts (and fiction) about fish, omega-3s, vitamins, and herbs<br> � <b>Personal readiness:</b> how to assess emotional, financial, and physical readiness, including a preconception-friendly exercise program, plus advice for avid athletes<br> � <b>Becoming an informed patient:</b> choosing a doctor, insurance coverage, baby-friendly medications, and the latest genetic screening guidelines<br> � <b>Women&#x2019;s health:</b> expanded coverage of gynecologic and medical conditions affecting fertility and pregnancy (including bariatric surgery and physical disabilities), and steps to create a welcoming womb by optimizing immune health<br> � <b>Environment:</b> a roundup of environmental exposures and travel tips<br> � <b>Men&#x2019;s health:</b> practical lifestyle advice for men to help maximize the number and health of sperm<br> � <b>Conception:</b> clear signs that predict when to &#x201c;start trying,&#x201d; and the truth behind common myths<br> � <b>Infertility:</b> reassuring options for reproductive assistance<br> � <b>Interconception health:</b> the best plan for pregnancy recovery, before trying for another<br> � <b>Resources:</b> questionnaires for your preconception medical visit, and charts to track fertility signs</p></p><p><p><b>Amy Ogle, M.S., R.D.</b>, is a registered dietitian, exercise physiologist, and ACE-certified personal trainer.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Lisa Mazzullo, M.D.</b>, is a practicing OB/GYN and assistant professor of OB/GYN at Northwestern University Medical School.</p>I N T R O D U C T I O N <br>Don&#x2019;t Just Conceive: Preconceive!<br><br>It is every prospective parent&#x2019;s dream to have a child who is happy, bright, engaging, and healthy enough to experience life to its fullest. Whether you are thinking of trying to conceive for the first time or have been down this road before, we would like to help you improve your chances of making this dream come true, just as we have for countless men and women under similar circumstances. In fact, it was in the year 1995 that the idea for Before Your Pregnancy came into being. At the time, Amy, a registered dietitian, exercise physiologist, and personal trainer, was working with patients and private clients who were pregnant&#x2014;with or without complications&#x2014;or within a year or two of having had a child. She was impressed by their motivation and surprised by the number of times she heard the remark &#x201c;If only I knew then what I know now, I&#x2019;d have taken better care of myself before I got pregnant.&#x201d; It got her thinking about why there wasn&#x2019;t more emphasis from the medical community on health during the months before conception. After all, the scientific literature was brimming with new information on ways women and men could prepare their bodies for conception and improve the baby&#x2019;s health, actions that often made a difference only if begun one to three months before trying to conceive. Unfortunately, virtually none of this information was widely available to the general public.<br><br>Determined to get the word out, Amy wrote and produced a video and accompanying booklet entitled Before Your Pregnancy that provided preconception nutritional and exercise advice. (Coincidentally, she became pregnant while making the video, giving her a chance to practice what she preached!) One of the professionals who edited the text, Dr. Lisa Mazzullo, a board-certified ob-gyn and assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University Medical Center, happened to teach &#x201c;Maybe Baby&#x201d; classes at her hospital, covering the same topics from a medical and psychological point of view. The response to the video and preconception classes was so great that we, Amy and Lisa, ultimately decided to pool our expertise and create the book you hold in your hands, a complete resource for couples considering having a baby. <br><br>Most preconception discussions between patients and doctors&#x2014;if they occur at all&#x2014;are limited to &#x201c;Begin taking your folic acid, and have fun!&#x201d; The fact of the matter is, however, that there are many things you can do to improve your physical health and psychological readiness in the critical ninety-day period before conception. In this book we&#x2019;ll help you to thoroughly assess your emotional, financial, environmental, gynecologic, genetic, nutritional, and physical preparedness and provide detailed advice on how to improve in each area. If you follow our preconception guidelines, you will also improve your odds of <br>� Conceiving more easily <br>� Conceiving a healthier baby <br>� Giving the baby a &#x201c;smooth landing&#x201d; during implantation in the uterus and ensuring a strong placenta&#x2014;the vascular connection between mom and baby<br>&nbsp;� Having a healthier pregnancy <br>� Recovering more easily in the postpartum period <br>� Decreasing your child&#x2019;s risk for certain childhood and adult health problems <br><br>You may be wondering why certain baby-friendly actions must be implemented in the months prior to conception. After all, until fertilization occurs, there isn&#x2019;t even a baby in the picture. Well, the egg and sperm that will eventually become that baby go through crucial genetic preparations in the weeks before conception, and you want these to occur under the best circumstances. Because genetic defects do not all occur randomly, the prospect of having some control over this risk is immensely empowering. Also, consider that most birth defects&#x2014;many preventable&#x2014;occur between seventeen and fifty-six days after conception, often before a woman becomes aware that she is pregnant. Preconception readiness primes the woman&#x2019;s body so the baby can thrive in those early weeks of development. <br><br>Here&#x2019;s something else that&#x2019;s fascinating. The maternal body directs most of its focus and energy into building and &#x201c;remodeling&#x201d; the placenta during the first three months of pregnancy; it&#x2019;s like building a solid foundation with the best materials before pouring much energy into the structural details. The placenta has always been described as the critical component that orchestrates nutrient delivery and waste disposal via the umbilical cord. It also tries to run interference, if harmful substances get into the maternal bloodstream. What you may not know is that a healthy placenta that works in sync with the maternal immune system can be key to keeping the fetus &#x201c;on board&#x201d; and growing well for the full forty weeks of pregnancy.<br><br>This is an exciting area of ongoing research, one with many potential implications for preconception and pregnancy health. You&#x2019;ll see more discussion about this in a new feature beginning on page 163. <br><br>Take it from us: it is also a lot easier to continue healthy habits during pregnancy and beyond if you already have them in place before you are pregnant. And eventually your children will learn the healthy habits that you, their parents, model. <br><br>We cannot emphasize enough that the preconception actions of both partners, not solely the woman, can make a difference in the health of their future child. Ultimate success comes when you both feel equally important and act synergistically as a team. You will find a lot of information in this book to help the prospective dad become healthier, better informed, and more involved in what lies ahead. <br><br>We share your enthusiasm for wanting to make your body a safe and healthy place for your baby to thrive. <br><br>HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF OUR BOOK <br><br>Are you planning your pregnancy several months to a year in advance, or have you already started trying? How you use this book largely depends on your personal time frame for conception. As mentioned earlier, we recommend following these guidelines for at least ninety days before trying to conceive. This time frame is ultimately best for most situations but may not be practical or necessary in all cases; we&#x2019;ll make a point of noting when something should be heeded earlier or later than the ninety-day timeline. Depending on what you discover from this book about your current state of preconception readiness, you may come to the conclusion that it is in your interest to postpone your plans for a few months. In the grand scheme of things, a relatively short delay is a small price to pay for improving your odds for a healthier outcome. <br><br>We&#x2019;ve organized this book according to how you might naturally approach preparing for pregnancy. Long before you and your partner discuss preconception readiness with a health care professional, you&#x2019;ll determine whether you&#x2019;re mentally and financially ready to welcome a new being into your life. At the same time, you may start looking at your lifestyle habits (e.g., smoking, drinking) and your home and away-from-home environments with questions of wholesomeness and safety in mind. After these initial considerations, we get to the heart of preconception health, nutrition, and fitness for women and men. Finally, Chapter 17, &#x201c;Romancing the Egg,&#x201d; can be referred to when you&#x2019;re both ready to start &#x201c;trying&#x201d;; there&#x2019;s now a fast-track (&#x201c;zoom&#x201d; ) and laid-back (&#x201c;Zen&#x201d; ) approach, depending on your personal needs. <br><br>It might be helpful for you to take a peek at &#x201c;Romancing the Egg&#x201d; (Chapter 17), just to get an idea of where you&#x2019;re headed and find out your &#x201c;Fertility &#x2018;Personality&#x2019; Profile.&#x201d; The profile is there to guide readers who have completed the majority of the book&#x2014;and their ninety days of preconception planning&#x2014;so we kept it there despite the urge to place it earlier. <br><br>Should you experience infertility, a new chapter (Chapter 18) will help reassure and guide you, including new information and specific cross-references to other parts of the book that might have initially only been skimmed. Then we delve right into ways to reassess, complement your own efforts, and get the right help to achieve your goal of having a baby. <br><br><i>Before Your Pregnancy</i> is meant to be an interactive book. We encourage you to write in the blank spaces, margins, and charts. Dog-ear plenty of pages, and highlight pertinent advice with a pen or colored marker. Approach this as you would a delectable barbecue dinner: you cannot thoroughly enjoy the meal if you and your napkin remain spotless. <br><br>To further encourage you to participate in the learning process we feature exercises called Practical Applications. As the term suggests, these typically take the topic under discussion into your own specific circumstances. For example, in the section on women&#x2019;s medical issues, one Practical Application is to look in your medicine cabinet and write down all the medications, herbs, and supplements you find, familiarize yourself with what we recommend about them, and note which ones you should ask your physician about. <br><br>Although the information in this book is written for couples, we address the prospective mother as &#x201c;you,&#x201d; unless stated otherwise. We&#x2019;re making the assumption that, for the most part, it will be women who read this book and then share pertinent portions with their partners. (Kudos to you men who ran across this book first.) <br><br>You will also notice that we use several interchangeable terms throughout the book. For example, the yet-to-be-conceived baby and the baby while in the womb both are referred to as either the fetus or the baby. Your primary health care provider is referred to most of the time as a doctor or physician but could just as easily be a nurse midwife, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant. Finally, we use the terms partner, husband, wife, baby&#x2019;s mother/father, mate, or spouse interchangeably. <br><br>Many of the recommendations for pre-pregnancy are also applicable later on, often for completely different reasons. When that is the case, you will see boxes titled For Future Reference with symbols indicating when the reference is to &#x201c;during pregnancy&#x201d; , &#x201c;after delivery&#x201d; , or &#x201c;family life&#x201d; with children . These are for all of you information pack rats to tuck in the back of your minds for future use during the pregnancy and postpartum period. If you are the type who was driven crazy in school by a teacher who periodically went off on tangents, feel free to skim these! <br><br>This book will also help you become a more active participant in your health care. It will assist you in organizing any questions you may have for your doctor and help to clarify what he or she is telling you. That way you can make the best use of your appointment time and will be less likely to walk out of the office saying, &#x201c;Oh, I wish I had asked her about x, y, and z.&#x201d; <br><br>SETTING A NEW PRECEDENT <br><br>As you put our guidelines into action, remember that the practice of preconception care is still relatively new in comparison to the well-established practice of prenatal (during pregnancy) care&#x2014;so new, in fact, that you may periodically be faced with skepticism from your family, friends, and even some health care workers. Your partner may question the necessity of it. Don&#x2019;t be swayed or discouraged if people say that couples have been having healthy babies for hundreds of thousands of years and very few of them did anything to plan ahead for conception; or if they point out that there are women who abuse their bodies with drugs and an unhealthy lifestyle and then have healthy babies despite it all. It&#x2019;s true that women give birth to healthy babies under less than ideal circumstances&#x2014;thank goodness for this general resiliency! Even so, preconception planning does improve one&#x2019;s overall odds for giving a baby a head start from the very moment of conception. The particulars of how and how much it helps will vary among individuals.<br><br>&nbsp;Occasionally we encounter a prospective parent who finds the thought of planning for pregnancy unappealing because of religious or cultural beliefs. Or you and your partner may prefer to be spontaneous and just see what happens. However, the words planning and spontaneity are not diametrically opposed. Although some couples will meticulously plan to &#x201c;start trying,&#x201d; true preconception readiness is a lifestyle practice in case pregnancy should occur. Considering that almost half of all pregnancies are unplanned, this type of general pre-pregnancy readiness is a good idea for any couple of childbearing age. Following these guidelines will mean that you and your partner will be optimally ready to create a baby at any time, whether you intend to become pregnant or not. <br><br>Over the course of our careers we have counseled thousands of couples who, like you, are planning to start trying to get pregnant. Their experiences have inspired the many scenarios we have created to illustrate the information in this book. In addition, many experts outside our respective fields&#x2014;psychologists, social workers, financial planners, public health advocates, geneticists, urologists/male infertility specialists, immunologists, pediatricians, and herbal researchers&#x2014;have generously shared their knowledge with us to make this book as complete a resource as possible. We extend our gratitude to all who have contributed to our understanding of what it means to want a child and to selflessly act in his or her favor before conception. We thank you, too, for caring enough to learn, as we have. <br><br>Amy Ogle, MS, RD</p><h2>Spirit Wars Workbook: Winning the Invisible Battle Against Sin and the Enemy</h2><p><b>As You Approach Your Destiny, the Enemy Will Do Anything to Stop You<br><br></b>In the invisible war raging around us, many believers struggle with fear, anxiety, depression, self-hatred and panic attacks. <br><br><i>Why?

The town of Ringgold, Georgia, has a population of 1,923, one traffic light, one Dairy Queen, and one Catherine Grace Cline. The daughter of Ringgold&#x2019;s third-generation Baptist preacher, Catherine Grace is quick-witted, more than a little stubborn, and dying to escape her small-town life.<br><br> Every Saturday afternoon, she sits at the Dairy Queen, eating Dilly Bars and plotting her getaway to Atlanta. And when, with the help of a family friend, the dream becomes a reality, she immediately packs her bags, leaving her family and the boy she loves to claim the life she&#x2019;s always imagined. But before things have even begun to get off the ground in Atlanta, tragedy brings Catherine Grace back home. As a series of extraordinary events alter her perspective--and sweeping changes come to Ringgold itself--Catherine Grace begins to wonder if her place in the world may actually be, against all odds, right where she began.<br><br> Intelligent, charming, and utterly readable, <i>Looking for Salvation at the Dairy Queen</i> marks the debut of a talented new literary voice.</p><p><b>Susan Gregg Gilmore</b> is the author of the novels <i>Looking for Salvation at the Dairy Queen</i> and <i>The Improper Life of Bezellia Grove</i>.

So every night before I went to bed I got down on my knees and begged the Lord to find me a way out of this town. And every morning, I woke up in the same old place.<br><br>It was a place that I, Catherine Grace Cline, never wanted to call home, even though I was born and raised here. It was a place where everybody knew everything about you, down to the color of underwear your mama bought you at the Dollar General Store. It was a place that just never felt right to me, like a sweater that fits too tight under your arms. It was a place where girls like me traded their dreams for a boy with a couple of acres of land and a wood-framed house with a new electric stove. It was a place I always planned on leaving.<br><br>When I was no more than nine years old, a tornado tore right close to my house. I remember yelling at my little sister to run and hide in the basement. &#x201c;Martha Ann,&#x201d; I warned her, &#x201c;if that twister hits this town, nobody&#x2019;s even going to notice it&#x2019;s gone.&#x201d;<br><br>She started crying for fear she was going to be swept up in the clouds and carried away, and nobody, not even our daddy, would be able to find her. Turned out the only thing of any importance swept up in the sky that day was Mr. Naylor&#x2019;s old hound dog. People said that Buster Black flew some fifteen miles, those long lonesome ears of his flapping like wings, before landing in the middle of some cornfield over in the next county.<br><br>Mr. Naylor walked for miles looking for that dad-gum dog till finally my daddy and the sheriff had to go pick him up. And just when that poor man finished planting a wooden cross by Buster&#x2019;s little house, darn it, if that four-legged fool didn&#x2019;t come limping back home, wagging his tail and acting like he&#x2019;d found the Promised Land. Mr. Naylor was crying, praising the Lord, holding Buster Black in his arms. The local newspaper ran a color picture of them both right on the front page, like that dog was some kind of prodigal son.<br><br>&#x201c;You know, Martha Ann,&#x201d; I told her after reading about Buster&#x2019;s triumphant return, &#x201c;a tornado like that just might be our ticket out of here, but unlike that stupid old hound dog, we are not going to limp back home.&#x201d;<br><br>My daddy said I was a little girl with a big imagination. Maybe. Or maybe I was a patient girl with a big dream, or a despairing girl waiting for her divine deliverance. But either way, I was going to hitch a ride out of Ringgold, whether it was on a fiery twister ripping a path through the Georgia sky or on a Greyhound bus rolling its way down Interstate 75.<br><br>Truth be told, I never even liked the name Ringgold. I mean, there&#x2019;s nothing in these green rolling hills that even faintly resembles a ring of gold, a ring of anything for that matter. And believe me, me and Martha Ann looked, somehow figuring that if we could find a ring of trees or ancient rocks, then just maybe our living here would have some kind of meaning. But after years of searching, the best I could figure was that it was just these darn hills that I had stared at every morning from my bedroom window that formed the ring, the ring that had kept me hostage for the first eighteen years of my life.<br><br>Nobody much ever bothers to visit this town except the truckers who stop to fill their fuel tanks because they can get some of the cheapest gas in the state here and Mrs. Gloria Jean Graves&#x2019;s second cousin, who has come up from Birmingham every year for the Thanksgiving holiday since before I was born. She always said it was refreshing to get away from the big city for a few days.<br><br>One time the governor came by for about twenty-five minutes to cut a ribbon at the new elementary-school library. Everybody in town came out to see him. Daddy made me wear a dress and tie my hair back in a ribbon, just like I was going to church. Six days a week my daddy didn&#x2019;t care too much how I looked, but on Sunday mornings there was no negotiating the dress code. My sister and I wore our very best dresses with a fresh pair of cotton panties underneath, out of respect for the Lord, Daddy said.<br><br>I really didn&#x2019;t think Jesus cared what I wore to Cedar Grove Baptist Church, or to see the governor for that matter, considering the fact that in every picture I ever saw of the King of Kings, He was wearing sandals and bundled up in nothing more than a big, baggy robe. But I figured this governor must be the most important person I was ever going to meet if Daddy was making me wear my navy blue Sunday dress with the white lacy collar and my patent-leather Mary Janes.<br><br>Martha Ann pitched such a fit about wearing her Sunday clothes that Daddy ended up leaving her at home with a neighbor. My little sister is a couple of years younger than I am, but she has always been a couple of inches taller, my guess from the time she came into this world. She has thick, dark brown hair and deep brown eyes like our mama. I have blue eyes like my daddy and straight brown hair that looks more like the color of a field mouse.<br><br>Martha Ann was a pretty baby and a pretty girl. Everything on her face just fits together so perfectly. When we were little, people said we looked just like twins for no better reason than we might have been wearing the same color shirt. You had to wonder if they were truly looking at us. But one thing was for certain, Martha Ann hated putting on her Sunday clothes even more than I did. She&#x2019;d have much rather been in the library picking out a new book to read than waiting to look at some strange man cut a ribbon.<br><br>I told her that if she didn&#x2019;t stop all that stomping and snorting, she was going to get left behind. And sure enough, she did. She had to spend the entire afternoon with Ida Belle Fletcher shucking eighty-four ears of corn for Wednesday-night supper over at the church.<br><br>Ida Belle said she cooked for the Lord, but all I knew was that she smelled like an unsavory combination of leftover bacon grease and Palmolive soap. She kept her big, round tummy covered with a tattered, old apron permanently stained with the meals of another day. The only time I saw her without that apron was when she was sitting in church, and then she kept it folded in her pocketbook.<br><br>My patent-leather shoe rubbed a blister on my big toe, but it was worth it. The governor turned out to be, if nothing else, the most handsome-looking man I&#x2019;d ever seen. He wore a dark navy suit and a crisp white shirt that must have been starched so stiff, it could&#x2019;ve stood up on its own. A red-and-blue-striped tie was pulled around his neck, and the tip of a white handkerchief was peeking out of his suit pocket. I had never seen a man dressed so fancy. He was in Ringgold for only a few minutes, and then he jumped in the back of a long, black car and sped off down Highway 151. I wanted to go with him so bad that for weeks after that, when I went to bed at night, I got down on my knees and begged the Lord to make me the governor&#x2019;s daughter.<br><br>But He didn&#x2019;t bother to answer that prayer either, not that I really thought that He would. God put me here for a reason, Daddy kept telling me; I just hadn&#x2019;t figured it out yet.<br><br>Now I know my father was a certified man of God, but at a fairly young age, I decided that when it came to my destiny, he did not know what he was talking about. He certainly did not understand that there was nothing for me here in Ringgold, Georgia. Sometimes I wondered if he had noticed that this town had only one red light, one part-time sheriff, and one post office, which was nothing more than a gray metal trailer perched on a bunch of cinder blocks in the back of the Shop Rite parking lot.<br><br>There was one losing high-school football team and one diner, which has been serving pork chops on Thursdays since 1962. There was one fire station, but it burned down five or six years ago when the entire fire department, which amounted to the sum total of Edward and Lankford Bostleman, were spending the night at their aunt&#x2019;s house over in LaFayette.</p><h2>House of God</h2><p>The medical hierarchy of The House of God is like a pyramid - a lot at the bottom and one at the top.

But how? More homework? Better-qualified teachers? Longer school days or school years? More testing? More funding? No, no, no, no, and no. <i>Montessori Madness!</i> explains why the incremental steps politicians and administrators continue to propose are incremental steps in the wrong direction. The entire system must be turned on its head. This book asks parents to take a look one thirty-minute observation at a Montessori school. Your picture of what education should look like will never be the same. <p> <i>Montessori Madness!<i></i> follows one family with young children on their journey of determination, discovery, and delight. Learn the who, what, when, where, why, and how of Montessori education. </i></p><p><i> This book makes an aggressive, humorous, and passionate case for a brilliant method of education that has received too little attention, very likely because it is based on a revolutionary, dangerous, and shocking concept: children love to learn!</i></p></p><p>Trevor Eissler, father of three children attending Montessori schools, is a pilot and flight instructor. His teaching experience is in a jet airplane cockpit at 40,000 feet. The painfully slow evolution of pilot training was brought home to him while observing 3 year-olds in a Montessori classroom. The learning principles that leading-edge aviation instructors were trying to implement (while running up against entrenched bureaucracy in aviation) were the very same principles already implemented and proving wildly successful in Montessori classrooms. <p> Researching these learning principles and practices, observing his children's progress, and experiencing a new way of looking at children, family, and community through the Montessori lens convinced him of the urgent need to let other families know about this wonderful education option. </p><p> Eissler is an author, a juggler, a unicyclist, a Toastmaster, a pianist, a triathlete, and a husband. He wants to be a Montessori student when he grows up.</p>Just what the wider educational community needs a book written with passion and understanding by a Montessori parent to other parents. Trevor Eissler is a rare parent who can put into writing his enthusiasm and first-hand experience as a Montessori advocate to other parents. ---Barbara Gordon, President, Montessori Institute of Texas; Founder, Barbara Gordon Montessori School<br><br>I am excited that our faculty will be reading Montessori Madness! this summer for our summer reading selection. It is a very practical perspective from a parent that gives great insight and answers to the questions that our parent body seems to be seeking. This book gives us very tangible topics to discuss with parents in the upcoming years. ---Michele Shane, Head of School, The Children's House<br><br>What's great about this book is that it is written by a Montessori parent for other parents who may or may not have already discovered Montessori education for their children. It's easy reading and passionately makes the case for choosing Montessori. ---Nirvair Khalsa, Head of School, Khalsa Montessori School</p><h2>Firefly - Big Damn Hero</h2><p><b><b>The original novel tying into the critically acclaimed and much-missed Firefly series from creator Joss Whedon.</b></b><br><br>The Battle of Serenity Valley was the turning point that led the Independents to their defeat at the hands of the Alliance.

Granted unprecedented access to the Los Angeles Juvenile Court, including the judges, the probation officers, and the children themselves, Edward Humes creates an unforgettable portrait of a chaotic system that is neither saving our children in danger nor protecting us from adolescent violence. Yet he shows us there is also hope in the handful of courageous individuals working tirelessly to triumph over seemingly insurmountable odds.<br> <br>Weaving together a poignant, compelling narrative with razor-sharp investigative reporting, <i>No Matter How Loud I Shout</i> is a convincingly reported, profoundly disturbing discussion of the Los Angeles juvenile court&#x2019;s failings, providing terrifying evidence of the system&#x2019;s inability to slow juvenile crime or to make even a reasonable stab at rehabilitating troubled young offenders. Humes draws an alarming portrait of a judicial system in disarray.</p><p>This is one powerful book: it will grab you with vivid stories about individual kids, draw you in with honesty and compassion, and amaze you with alarming details about how the juvenile justice system works (or rather, doesn't work) in America. Anyone interested in the problem of crime should read Edward Humes's gripping account of how future criminals are shaped in youth, and how the system misses its chance to help them before they're lost for good. As Richard Bernstein writes in the <i>New York Times</i>, "There are many admirable things about Mr. Humes's book, which, despite its grim subject matter, has a narrative power that keeps you reading right to the end. One of them is that Mr. Humes is a shrewd and perceptive observer of his young subjects ... [and he] allows himself to feel sympathy for the young people whose lives and crimes he describes.... At the same time, Mr. Humes never exonerates bad children for their badness." <i>No Matter How Loud I Shout</i> was a finalist for the 1997 Edgar Award in Fact Crime.Edward Humes, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for specialized reporting, is the author of&nbsp;many critically acclaimed nonfiction books including, <i>Monkey Girl</i>,<i> School of Dreams</i>,<i> Mississippi Mud</i>,<i> Mean Justice</i>,<i> </i>and <i>Garbology</i>.

While a handful of teachers in a school might be using differentiation to great success, it takes a collaborative, schoolwide approach to maximize differentiation s effectiveness and improve outcomes for all students.<br>Leading for Differentiation lays out the reflective thinking and action-oriented steps necessary to launch a system of continuous professional learning, culture building, and program assessment that will allow differentiation to take root and flourish in every classroom. Incorporating their own experienced insights, real-world examples, and practical tools, world-renowned differentiated instruction expert Carol Ann Tomlinson and change leadership authority Michael Murphy explore<br> Why a move to schoolwide differentiation makes so much sense for today s students and today s standards- and accountability-focused climate<br> How to transform a vision for schoolwide differentiation into manageable, year-by-year plans to achieve it<br> How to incorporate the principles of differentiation, motivation, and adult learning into respectful, responsive, and truly effective professional learning throughout all stages of the change initiative<br> How to foster and recognize growth in teachers differentiation practices, and how to chart the impact differentiation is having on student learning<br> How to recognize, understand, and respond to resistance in both its predictable forms and surprising ones<br> What schoolwide differentiation looks like when it s fully established, and how to tend to it for long-term success<br>Leading the change to a differentiated school means creating an environment in which each individual feels valued, challenged, supported, and part of a team working together for success. In this book, school leaders will learn how to set the course for positive change and create the structural supports that will help teachers grow as differentiators so that their students will thrive as learners.</p><p>Carol Ann Tomlinson s career as an educator includes 21 years as a public school teacher.

No real space to let the conscious mind judge action and reaction, no time for decisions about form and flow. The mind was far too slow to defend her in this life-or-death situation. She had to trust muscle memory, had to let go of any connection to past or future concerns. She had to be totally and completely in the now, if she was to survive this battle.<br> &nbsp;<br> Even these thoughts passed in the space of no more than a heartbeat.<br> &nbsp;<br> Barriss Offee cut and slashed with her lightsaber, whirling and twirling it, her movements weaving a shield of luminous energy before her, stopping blaster bolts, arrows, swords, even a few slung rocks, without reflecting any directly back toward the attackers. That was of vital importance, and the hardest part of the battle&#x2014;don&#x2019;t kill any of them. Master Kenobi had been adamant on that. Do not lop off arms or legs or heads; do not thrust through the bodies of their attackers. Not those of the Borokii, nor those of the Januul.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was much harder to fight and disarm or wound than to maim or kill. It was always harder to do the right thing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Barriss fought&#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> Next to her, Anakin Skywalker was displaying a fair skill with his lightsaber, though his technique was still somewhat rough. He had come into training much later than had most Jedi Padawans, but he was managing quite well. She sensed through the Force that he wanted to do more, that he wanted to strike them all down, but he held himself in check. She could feel the difficulty he was having in doing so, however. And that slight smile on his face as he wove a defensive energy web before him bothered her just a bit. He seemed to be enjoying this far too much.<br> &nbsp;<br> To her left, Master Kenobi&#x2019;s buzzing energy blade stitched an ozone-scented tapestry of blurred light, knocking blaster bolts into the ground, blocking incoming arrows, and shattering durasteel blades almost too fast for the eye to follow. His expression was set, grim.<br> &nbsp;<br> Moving with that incredibly supple grace that was her hallmark, Master Unduli danced her defense, deflecting the attacks with ease. Barriss stood beside her tutor, her blue blade moving in perfect synchronization with the pale green shimmer of her Master&#x2019;s lightsaber. Separately, each was an opponent to be reckoned with; together, merged by and in the Force, they were a fighting unit far stronger and faster than the sum of its two parts. So thoroughly and completely did they complement each other&#x2019;s feints, parries, and blocks that many of the wild Ansionian plainsfolk stared in disbelief even as they pressed their attack.<br> &nbsp;<br> When the howlpack had first advanced despite her practiced skill, Barriss had felt a surge of fear; there were so many of them, and to control without killing was much, much harder. But now, as she leapt and parried and swung her weapon, the Force guiding her every move, the initial panic was gone. With the four of them together this way, she had never felt the Force flow as strongly as it did now. She was with Anakin and Master Kenobi, nearly as completely as she was with Master Unduli. It was an unbelievably powerful, heady sensation, intoxicating, overriding, filling her with confidence: We can do it&#x2014;we can defeat both armies&#x2014;!<br> &nbsp;<br> Rationally, she knew this could not be, but the conviction was a thing of the heart, not the mind. They were invincible. They batted death from the air: full-power particle beams, needle-tipped arrows, swords sharp enough to shave the Ansionians&#x2019; long manes&nbsp;...<br> &nbsp;<br> It seemed to go on for a long time&#x2014;hours, at least&#x2014;but when it was at last done, Barriss realized that the entire encounter had taken perhaps ten minutes or less. Dozens of shattered weapons lay at their feet, and the surprised combatants surrounded them, plainly in awe of the fighting skills of the Jedi.<br> &nbsp;<br> As well they should be&nbsp;...<br> &nbsp;<br> Barriss smiled at the memory of the encounter on Ansion. She had felt the Force many times, before and since, but never had it been that&nbsp;...&nbsp;compelling. Even when they had demonstrated their &#x201c;spirit&#x201d; for the Alwari&#x2014;she with her compass dance, Anakin with his singing, Master Obi-Wan Kenobi with his storytelling, and Master Luminara Unduli with her Force-sculpture of whirling sand&#x2014;she had not felt so alive as during the battle, fighting alongside her Master and the others. Fighting alone was one thing, but fighting in tandem or in a group? That was much, much more.<br> &nbsp;<br> But that was the past, and if she had learned nothing else from her years in the Jedi Temple, she had learned that the past could be revisited, but not relived. She was no longer on Ansion now, but on Drongar, that humid hothouse of a world, and even though her mission to find the thief who had been stealing the valuable bota crop grown here was over, she had yet to hear from her Master as to the next step in her training.<br> &nbsp;<br> Even as she felt frustration rising again within her, her desktop comm unit warbled. She activated it, and a small holoproj image of her teacher shimmered into view in the warm air. The comm unit was small, and it seemed to have a slight malfunction; aside from the usual blinking and ghosting common when communicating across many parsecs, some element in the power amplifier seemed to be emitting a too-warm-circuit smell, so subtle that she was uncertain if she was actually sensing it or simply imagining it. It was a not-unpleasant odor that reminded Barriss of roasted klee-klee nuts.<br> &nbsp;<br> Master Unduli was lightyears away now, back on Coruscant, albeit her image was close enough to touch. The three-dimensional likeness was insubstantial, though, and it would be like trying to touch a ghost.<br> &nbsp;<br> Barriss sighed, feeling tension loosen within her. Here on Drongar she had felt the separation from her instructor keenly. Just the sight of Master Unduli, even in a flickering, low-res holocast, was enough to help center her. And she badly needed centering. What with the Rimsoo&#x2019;s recent forced relocation, some fifty-odd kilometers to the south to avoid being destroyed by Separatist battle droids, along with Zan Yant&#x2019;s death and the nonstop batches of incoming wounded, she felt badly in need of the calming, centering influence that her teacher always brought with her.<br> &nbsp;<br> After a mutual greeting, Barriss said, &#x201c;So, I suppose my mission here on Drongar is finished.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Master Unduli cocked her head. &#x201c;And why would you suppose that?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Barriss regarded the image, suddenly uncertain. &#x201c;Well&nbsp;...&nbsp;I was sent here to find out who was stealing bota. The ones responsible for that, the Hutt Filba and Admiral Bleyd, are no longer doing so, being dead. The military has dispatched a new admiral to command Med-Star and the Rimsoo facilities planetside&#x2014;he should be here shortly, and I expect he&#x2019;s been selected for his honesty, given the value of the bota crop.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That was only part of your mission, Padawan. You are also a healer, and there are still people there in need of that, are there not?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Barriss blinked. &#x201c;Yes, Master, but&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> There was a pause as her teacher regarded her. &#x201c;But you don&#x2019;t think that sufficient reason, do you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;With all due respect, I seem to be making very little difference here. It&#x2019;s like trying to move a beach full of sand one grain at a time. I could be replaced easily by any competent physician.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And you think that your talents would be better utilized elsewhere.&#x201d; It was not a question.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, my Master. I do.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Master Unduli smiled. Even in the flickering projection Barriss could see those intensely blue eyes twinkle. &#x201c;Of course you do. You are young, and your desire to be a shining force for good has blinded you somewhat to things all around you that still need attention. But I sense that you are not done there yet, my impatient Padawan. There are still lessons to be learned. Spirits require healing, too, as much or more than do bodies sometimes. I will contact you when I think it is time for you to leave Drongar.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Master Unduli&#x2019;s image winked out.<br> &nbsp;<br> Barriss sat on her cot for a time. She reached for calmness of spirit and found it difficult to acquire. Her Master&#x2019;s purpose in keeping her here eluded her. Yes, she was a healer, and yes, she had saved a few lives, but she could do that anywhere. There seemed little on this fecund planet that would help her become a fully fledged Jedi Knight. It seemed to her that her Master should be looking for some place to properly test her, to challenge all her skills, and not just those of a healer.<br> &nbsp;<br> But instead, Master Unduli had decided to leave her on this soggy dirtball, where battles were fought as they had seldom been fought in the last thousand years&#x2014;on the ground, between armies fielded to wage war cautiously to avoid damaging the valuable bota plant that grew thicker here than anywhere in the known galaxy. Bota&#x2014;a miraculous adaptogenic growth from which a variety of wondrous drugs could be made&#x2014;was easily prone to damage, and even a mild concussion from an explosion too close could kill an entire field of it. Sometimes even the thunder from a nearby lightning strike&#x2014;of which there were plenty, this being a young and volatile world&#x2014;could damage the fragile plant. Neither the Republic nor the Confederacy wanted that, so the weapons and tactics of the war here were primitive in the extreme. Battle droids fought clone troopers mostly within hand-blaster range, in small numbers, and without much in the way of artillery or large power beams. When the plant over which both sides battled for control was worth its weight in precious gems, nobody wanted to shock it to death or set it on fire&#x2014;which was all too easy to do in the high-oxygen environment, despite the swampy territory. While it was true that both sides had on occasion fielded heavier weaponry&#x2014;witness the recent Separatist attack that had required moving the entire base&#x2014;for the most part the infantries fought, and bled, for each precious centimeter of ground, all because of the kid-glove approach that bota required. Not for the first time Barriss wondered how an indigenous plant that was so fragile had managed to cling to its ecological niche for so long on such a tempestuous world.<br> &nbsp;<br> Such questions did not matter now. All that mattered was that the bota thief was dead&#x2014;and yet, Master Unduli still bade her stay. Why? What was the point?<br> &nbsp;<br> She shook off the thoughts. Clarity of mind did not come with too much thinking&#x2014;quite the opposite, in fact. She needed to empty herself, to allow the Force to provide the calm and serenity it always did&#x2014;when she could reach it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Some days, it was a lot harder than others.</p><h2>Liberty: The History: Treasures from the Archives of the Luxury Department Store</h2><p>Liberty is a heritage brand with one foot firmly planted in the future.

Then, in her seventh year, on a calm summer day, fiery dragons from the North swooped down upon the peaceful farm that was Adara's home.

That was the sort of question that often troubled her brother Geoff, who was two years older than her and insatiably curious, but Adara did not care about such things. So long as the cold and the snow and the ice dragon all arrived on schedule, she was happy.<br>&nbsp;<br>She always knew when they were due because of her birthday. Adara was a winter child, born during the worst freeze that anyone could remember, even Old Laura, who lived on the next farm and remembered things that had happened before anyone else was born. People still talked about that freeze. Adara often heard them.<br>&nbsp;<br>They talked about other things as well. They said it was the chill of that terrible freeze that had killed her mother, stealing in during her long night of labor past the great fire that Adara&#x2019;s father had built, and creeping under the layers of blankets that covered the birthing bed. And they said that the cold had entered Adara in the womb, that her skin had been pale blue and icy to the touch when she came forth, and that she had never warmed in all the years since. The winter had touched her, left its mark upon her, and made her its own.<br>&nbsp;<br>It was true that Adara was always a child apart. She was a very serious little girl who seldom cared to play with the others. She was beautiful, people said, but in a strange, distant sort of way, with her pale skin and blond hair and wide clear blue eyes. She smiled, but not often. No one had ever seen her cry. Once when she was five she had stepped upon a nail imbedded in a board that lay concealed beneath a snowbank, and it had gone clear through her foot, but Adara had not wept or screamed even then. She had pulled her foot loose and walked back to the house, leaving a trail of blood in the snow, and when she had gotten there she had said only, &#x201c;Father, I hurt myself.&#x201d; The sulks and tempers and tears of ordinary childhood were not for her.<br>&nbsp;<br>Even her family knew that Adara was different. Her father was a huge, gruff bear of a man who had little use for people in general, but a smile always broke across his face when Geoff pestered him with questions, and he was full of hugs and laughter for Teri, Adara&#x2019;s older sister, who was golden and freckled, and flirted shamelessly with all the local boys. Every so often he would hug Adara as well, but only during the long winters. But there would be no smiles then. He would only wrap his arms around her, and pull her small body tight against him with all his massive strength, sob deep in his chest, and fat wet tears would run down his ruddy cheeks. He never hugged her at all during the summers. During the summers he was too busy.<br>&nbsp;<br>Everyone was busy during the summers except for Adara. Geoff would work with his father in the fields and ask endless questions about this and that, learning everything a farmer had to know. When he was not working he would run with his friends to the river, and have adventures. Teri ran the house and did the cooking, and worked a bit at the inn by the crossroads during the busy season. The innkeeper&#x2019;s daughter was her friend, and his youngest son was more than a friend, and she would always come back giggly and full of gossip and news from travelers and soldiers and king&#x2019;s messengers. For Teri and Geoff the summers were the best time, and both of them were too busy for Adara.<br>&nbsp;<br>Their father was the busiest of all. A thousand things needed to be done each day, and he did them, and found a thousand more. He worked from dawn to dusk. His muscles grew hard and lean in summer, and he stank from sweat each night when he came in from the fields, but he always came in smiling. After supper he would sit with Geoff and tell him stories and answer his questions, or teach Teri things she did not know about cooking, or stroll down to the inn. He was a summer man, truly.<br>&nbsp;<br>He never drank in summer, except for a cup of wine now and again to celebrate his brother&#x2019;s visits.<br>&nbsp;<br>That was another reason why Teri and Geoff loved the summers, when the world was green and hot and bursting with life. It was only in summer that Uncle Hal, their father&#x2019;s younger brother, came to call. Hal was a dragonrider in service to the king, a tall slender man with a face like a noble. Dragons cannot stand the cold, so when winter fell Hal and his wing would fly south. But each summer he returned, brilliant in the king&#x2019;s green-and-gold uniform, en route to the battlegrounds to the north and west of them. The war had been going on for all of Adara&#x2019;s life.<br>&nbsp;<br>Whenever Hal came north, he would bring presents; toys from the king&#x2019;s city, crystal and gold jewelry, candies, and always a bottle of some expensive wine that he and his brother could share. He would grin at Teri and make her blush with his compliments, and entertain Geoff with tales of war and castles and dragons. As for Adara, he often tried to coax a smile out of her, with gifts and jests and hugs. He seldom succeeded.<br>&nbsp;<br>For all his good nature, Adara did not like Hal; when Hal was there, it meant that winter was far away.<br>&nbsp;<br>Besides, there had been a night when she was only four, and they thought her long asleep, that she overheard them talking over wine. &#x201c;A solemn little thing,&#x201d; Hal said. &#x201c;You ought to be kinder to her, John. You cannot blame her for what happened.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t I?&#x201d; her father replied, his voice thick with wine. &#x201c;No, I suppose not. But it is hard. She looks like Beth, but she has none of Beth&#x2019;s warmth. The winter is in her, you know. Whenever I touch her I feel the chill, and I remember that it was for her that Beth had to die.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You are cold to her. You do not love her as you do the others.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Adara remembered the way her father laughed then. &#x201c;Love her? Ah, Hal. I loved her best of all, my little winter child. But she has never loved back. There is nothing in her for me, or you, any of us. She is such a cold little girl.&#x201d; And then he had begun to weep, even though it was summer and Hal was with him. In her bed, Adara listened and wished that Hal would fly away. She did not quite understand all that she had heard, not then, but she remembered it, and the understanding came later.<br>&nbsp;<br>She did not cry; not at four, when she heard, or six, when she finally understood. Hal left a few days later, and Geoff and Teri waved to him excitedly when his wing passed overhead, thirty great dragons in proud formation against the summer sky. Adara watched with her small hands by her sides.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 1980 by George R. R.

In the same style as Cameron's previous "A Dog's Purpose" iterations, this addition is presented through a dog's-eye view, as Molly attempts to understand the world of her human. C.J. must keep Molly a secret from her extremely inattentive mother, Gloria. This is where the narrative takes a turn. Gloria is an extravagant spender who leaves her daughter unattended while she escapes on weekend ski trips. C.J. runs away for several weeks after a confrontation with her mother's boyfriend, and, oddly, Gloria does not report her daughter's disappearance or even speak to C.J.'s school.

Whereas many 'self-help' books focus exclusively on one or a few approaches to recovery, Dr. Towery recognizes that individuals are unique and there's no such thing as a 'magic bullet' or panacea that works for every person. Mood is influenced by many independent factors, and this book offers insights into finding the right combination of approaches to achieve sustained recovery from depression. These approaches include cognitive, motivational, interpersonal, behavioral, spiritual, and meditative practices, along with healthy exercise habits. I wish more child therapists and psychiatrists followed this approach to treating their patients with depression!" -Matthew May, MD Adjunct Clinical Faculty, Stanford Department of Psychiatry <br><br>"In this book, Dr. Towery combines his unparalleled experience with treating adolescents using the most cutting-edge psychological treatments for depression together with a direct, no-nonsense yet compassionate style of teaching and writing. His respectful, practical, and goal-oriented guidance in this book makes depressed teens accountable for the work needed to overcome depression. His treatment approach is systematic, clear, and wise, making this book easy to follow and extremely useful. I would want my teen struggling with depression to read this book." -Maor Katz, MD Director of the Feeling Good Institute <br><br>"Jacob Towery is my favorite adolescent psychiatrist. He is a seasoned clinician with a knack for simplifying the complex. In this book, he has created an owner's manual for the teenage brain, as well as a troubleshooting guide for those suffering with mood and anxiety difficulties. I am grateful that he has taken the time to disseminate his most effective strategies in a compilation of self-help techniques." -Kim Bullock, MD Clinical Associate Professor, Director of Stanford Neurobehavioral Clinic <br><br>"Dr. Towery has anapproachable, honest, and witty style that allows readers to connect to the life-changing messages in this book. He consistently addresses the lack of motivation experienced by many youth with depression and supports them in making changes. Dr. Towery compassionately pushes readers toward turning their lives around." -Angela Krumm, Ph.D. Adjunct Clinical Faculty, Stanford Department of Psychiatry <br><br>"The Anti-Depressant Book is a great book (and workbook) for teens suffering from depression. It is also an excellent guide for their parents who just want to help and wonder, 'What can I do?' The book makes working with cognitive behavioral therapy easy and approachable. It really focuses on ways to help people feel better in real time. It is a wonderful addition to my library and a great resource for my patients and their families." -Alexander Strauss, MD, DFAACAP, FAPA Clinical Assistant Professor, Department of Psychiatry at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School <br><br>"The Anti-Depressant Book is a fantastic resource for teens struggling with depression and the parents who support them.Dr. Towery highlights the active ingredients that will help your teen fully recover from depression, including: increasing sleep and exercise, mindfulness, cognitive therapy techniques, and gratitude exercises. Dr. Towery balances the need for self-compassion with careful accountability in this must-read, practical self-help book for teens with depression. If your son or daughter is struggling with depression, I highly recommend that you hurry up and get this book for them-it just might save their life!" -Jill Levitt, Ph.D. Adjunct Clinical Faculty, Stanford Department of Psychiatry"</p><h2>Baltimore Blues: The First Tess Monaghan Novel (Tess Monaghan Novel, 1)</h2><p><p>Discover the first novel in <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Laura Lippman's outstanding Tess Monaghan series! When a former Baltimore reporter must solve the murder of a notorious attorney, she discovers Charm City is rife with dark, sordid, and dangerous secrets.</p><p>In a city where someone is murdered almost every day, attorney Michael Abramowitz's death should be just another statistic. But the slain lawyer's notoriety&#x2014;and his taste for illicit midday trysts&#x2014;make the case front-page news in every local paper except the Star, which crashed and burned before Abramowitz did.</p><p>A former Star reporter who knows every inch of this town&#x2014;from historic Fort McHenry to the crumbling projects of Cherry Hill&#x2014;now-unemployed journalist Tess Monaghan also knows the guy the cops like for the killing: cuckolded fianc� Darryl "Rock" Paxton. The time is ripe for a career move, so when rowing buddy Rock wants to hire her to do some unorthodox snooping to help clear his name, Tess agrees.</p><p>But there are lethal secrets hiding in the Charm City shadows. And Tess's own name could end up on that ever-expanding list of Baltimore dead.</p></p><p><p>Since <strong>Laura Lippman's </strong>debut in 1997, she has been recognized as a distinctive voice in mystery fiction and named one of the "essential" crime writers of the last 100 years. Her books have won most of the major awards in her field and been translated into more than twenty languages. She&nbsp;lives in Baltimore and New Orleans with her family.</p>Lippman's sleuth, Tess Monaghan, has had several outings by now, but this is her first (1997). It was important to establish her character firmly and to involve her in a plot exciting enough to make readers come back for more. Deborah Hazlett backs Lippman's success vocally. She shows Tess as resourceful, emotionally steady, feisty, and clear thinking as the unemployed reporter investigates the murder of a controversial defense lawyer. Other characters, as well as the portrayal of the city of Baltimore, enrich the plot and, in most cases, the audio version. Hazlett's narration sounds a bit reportorial at times, a style that is perhaps a reflection of Tess's vocation and that of Lippman herself.

Really."&#x2014;Christiane Northrup, MD, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Goddesses Never Age </i>and <i>Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom</i></b><br><br> Many Americans have succumbed to the scare tactics of the dermatological community, and avoid sunlight for fear of skin cancer and premature aging. Therefore, most of us suffer from vitamin D deficiency, which causes daily aches, pains, and fatigue, worsens serious illnesses, and diminishes the quality of everyday life. Drawing on decades of research, Dr. Michael f. Holick reveals a well-kept secret: our bodies need a sensible amount of unprotected sun exposure. The most comprehensive rescriptive book on the market, <i>The Vitamin D Solution</i> offers readers an easy and inexpensive plan to reversing the effects of vitamin D deficiency-and enjoying a substantially healthier life.</p><p><b>Michael F. Holick</b>, Ph.d., M.D., is the director of the General Clinical Research Unit and professor of medicine, physiology, and biophysics at Boston University Medical Center. He has been quoted in <i>The New York Times, Forbes, Time, Newsweek, Men&#x2019;s Health</i>, and <i>Scientific American</i>. He lives in Massachusetts with his family.<b><p>CHAPTER 1 <br>What Is Vitamin D? </p></b><p>Is it a hormone or a vitamin? </p> <p>Somewhere along the equator a ten-year-old girl is growing up with- out the luxuries most of us enjoy on a daily basis. She will never learn how to use a computer, order a pizza to be delivered, or drive a car to the mall for clothes and cosmetics. She spends most of her days playing outside near her farming parents, and soon she will join them in tilling the soil. She will never learn to read or write. She will endure periods of poor nutrition and poverty. And she knows nothing about sunblock and probably never will. </p><p>Now let&#x2019;s sail north to the United States or Europe, where another ten-year-old girl leads an immensely different life. She is maturing into a savvy user of electronics, passes the majority of her days indoors at a rigorous school, has access to the best nutrition and all the benefits that modern medicine can provide, and will know what <i>SPF </i> means long before graduating from high school and pursing higher education. </p><p>If both girls continue on their separate paths, the equatorial girl will be at least half as likely to get cancer during her lifetime as her northern counterpart. She also will have an 80 percent reduced risk of developing type 1 diabetes in the first thirty years of her life. In fact, barring any freak accident or untreated medical condition, her longevity overall will be 7 percent <i>greater</i>. </p><p>The northern girl, on the other hand, faces a host of increased health risks throughout her life, from breast and ovarian cancer to depression, obesity, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, arthritis, high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. She will be more susceptible to upper-respiratory-tract infections, dental cavities and gum disease, and infectious diseases like the flu and tuberculosis. As a group, she and her girlfriends will break their arms 56 percent more often than their peers did just forty years ago. Because she was born in northern latitudes and has lived there for the first ten years of her life, for the rest of her life she has a 100 percent increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis no matter where she chooses to live in the world after age ten. She would likely lose in a jumping contest with her equatorial sister, who can jump higher and with more force. If she complains of muscle weakness and wide- spread muscle and joint pain later on in adulthood, her doctor will likely diagnose fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome when tests don&#x2019;t turn up anything specific. The equatorial girl might never experience such debilitating aches or chronic pain and in fact may develop into a much stronger, leaner, and more fertile woman. If both women become pregnant, the equatorial mom-to-be won&#x2019;t have to worry as much about serious complications like preeclampsia. And she won&#x2019;t have trouble giving birth the old-fashioned way. The northern mom-to-be, however, will have a much higher risk of having an unplanned C-section and of giving birth to a child who will suffer from schizophrenia. </p><p>By the time the northern girl reaches midlife and her later years, chances are good that she&#x2019;ll have been treated for an internal cancer (breast, colon, ovarian, pancreatic&#x2014;take your pick) at some point and been prescribed multiple drugs to combat chronic ailments like hypertension, osteoporosis, arthritis, depression, obesity, type 2 diabetes, dementia, Alzheimer&#x2019;s, and perhaps even insomnia. Because of a significant loss of bone mass, she will be terrified of falling and fracturing a bone, and therefore will have limited some of her favorite outdoor activities, such as tennis, skiing, horseback riding, and golf, significantly cutting back on physical activity. And because she will have lost a considerable amount of muscle strength, her biological age will be much older than she really is. The equatorial woman not only may outlive her northern counterpart, but she&#x2019;ll also be less prone to chronic diseases that afflict her northern counterpart. For this reason, the equatorial woman may, overall, enjoy a higher quality of life&#x2014;even when advanced age sets in. </p><p>What&#x2019;s going on here? The answer lies in the difference between these two girls&#x2019; exposure to natural sunlight, which is our main source of vita- min D. Obviously, I&#x2019;ve taken some liberty in letting a few assumptions go. The equatorial girl&#x2019;s limited access to health care and preventative medicine has its own basket of risks, but let&#x2019;s focus for a moment just on the difference in exposure to sunlight and the conclusions that can be drawn from that single fact. Let&#x2019;s also assume that these girls grow up to exhibit vastly different levels of vitamin D in their systems, which is not a stretch given the documented records of vitamin D deficiency patterns across the globe. If I were to test each of these girls&#x2019; vitamin D levels, I would not be surprised to find the northern girl&#x2019;s levels terribly low as compared to her equatorial counterpart. And that difference means everything. </p><p>The sun is as vital to your health and well-being as food, shelter, water, and oxygen. I&#x2019;m going to prove it to you through a comprehensive exploration of vitamin D. What does vitamin D have to do with aging and disease? </p><p>More than we ever imagined. </p><br><b><p>Our Most Common Health Challenge </p></b><p>When I tell people that vitamin D deficiency is our most common health challenge globally, the response I get is pretty much the same in wealthy, developed nations: &#x201c;Well, that can&#x2019;t happen to me or anyone else in my country; besides, we have great health care.&#x201d; And when I remind people that the best way to ensure healthy levels of vitamin D is through sensible sun exposure two to three times a week, a common thread is heard in the response, which is along the lines of, &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t be serious. The sun is the demon of cancer and aging. No way am I going to consider sunlight as medicine. It&#x2019;s just not possible.&#x201d;</p> <p>The statistics proving otherwise speak volumes, and you&#x2019;re going to hear about them throughout this book. Increasing numbers of studies are confirming the link between vitamin D and optimal health, and attitudes are beginning to shift. Researchers have long known that the &#x201c;sunshine vitamin&#x201d; boosts bone strength by encouraging the body to absorb calcium, but only recently have we begun to see just how far- reaching vitamin D is in maintaining the health of every system and cell in the body&#x2019;s intricate machinery. Vitamin D may be as vital to your heart and brain health, for example, as it is to your bone health. As noted in the introduction, increasing the amount of vitamin D in the body can prevent or help treat a remarkable number of ailments, from high blood pressure to back pain, from diabetes to arthritis, from upper-respiratory- tract infections to infectious diseases, and from fibromyalgia to cancer. It also seems to improve fertility, weight control, and memory. </p><p>The evidence is clear: just as we require a little fat and salt for survival, we need the sun in moderation, too. I&#x2019;ll add to that the following fact, which will be fully explored in chapter 8: there is essentially no substantiated scientific evidence to suggest that moderate sun exposure significantly increases risks of benign skin cancers or, and more importantly, the most deadly form of skin cancer, melanoma. In fact, if you were unfortunately to develop melanoma, you would be more likely to survive it if you had adequate sun exposure as a child and young adult. And if you had adequate sun exposure as a child, you would have a 40 percent reduced risk of developing lymphoma as a young adult. </p><p>In the past five years alone there has been a breakthrough in our understanding of why sun exposure benefits health in so many ways, something that was not fully comprehended until now. This breakthrough has forced people to take a closer look at the value of sun exposure. I am proud to say that I have been at the forefront of this research. </p><p>Groundbreaking new research has linked a wide array of disorders that afflict up to two hundred million Americans to a single common factor&#x2014;vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency, the most common medical condition in the world with sometimes devastating, if not fatal, consequences. </p><p>And the research keeps coming from various labs around the world investigating vitamin D. As I write this, doctors at the University of Pennsylvania have revealed that vitamin D can prevent or forestall the irreversible decline in respiratory function over time that leaves many asthmatics even more vulnerable when they suffer an asthma attack. At the same time, scientists at the Moores Cancer Center at the University of California at San Diego have raised the possibility that low vitamin D may be the root cause of cancer. No doubt we will continue to see remarkable studies emerge, and you&#x2019;ll be reading about some of the more fascinating and profound studies in the upcoming chapters. It&#x2019;s no wonder that this vitamin made <i>Time </i> magazine&#x2019;s list of the top ten medical breakthroughs of 2007. So if you can dramatically decrease your risk of illness and age-related disease and live a healthier, happier life&#x2014; without its costing you a penny&#x2014;wouldn&#x2019;t you want to do that? </p><br><b><p>Centuries of Problem Solving </p></b><p>When you put the vitamin D story into the perspective of human history, it begins with the Industrial Revolution. As the revolution began to sweep across northern Europe in the mid-seventeenth century, doctors reported seeing a new disease that afflicted young children with a constellation of physical signs and symptoms, notably deformities of the skeleton, such as bowed legs, misshapen pelvis, enlarged head, prominent knobby projections along the ribs, curvature of the spine, poor teeth, and weak and flabby legs. The disease had devastating consequences. It not only retarded growth and carried serious risk of upper- respiratory-tract infections including tuberculosis and influenza, but it also had far-reaching effects into adulthood and impaired these children&#x2019;s ability to function throughout their lives. Women with a distorted pelvis often had difficulty with childbirth and were at high risk of dying or giving birth to an unhealthy child. </p><p>Several theories about the cause of this debilitating disease called rickets surfaced in the early 1900s, including infection, lack of activity, poor nutrition, and an inherited disorder. Although cod liver oil (high in vitamin D) appeared to be effective in preventing the disease, it was principally used on the coastlines of the Scandinavian countries and the United Kingdom and was not widely used elsewhere. The disease continued to plague the industrial centers of the world. </p><p>What was happening was that as people began to congregate in Great Britain and northern Europe, they erected cities whose tightly placed buildings closed off to sunlight the alleys where kids were hanging out and living. Compounding the problem was the gathering pollution from coal burning, which thickened the air and blocked the sun&#x2019;s rays. When these kids started to show signs of bone deformities, doctors began to take note. </p><br><b><p>&#x201c;Water works wonders, air can do even more, but light works best of all.&#x201d; </p></b><p>In the 1820s, a Polish doctor named Jedrzej Sniadecki observed that children who lived in the city of Warsaw had a much higher prevalence of rickets than youngsters who lived in the Polish countryside. Dr. Sniadecki thought it was probably the lack of sunshine in the cramped confines of Warsaw that was to blame for this widespread condition. He was able to successfully treat the afflicted city kids by taking them into the country- side for sun exposure. But he wasn&#x2019;t taken seriously. It was inconceivable to the scientific community at the time that exposure of skin to sunlight could have any impact on the skeleton. Indeed, it would take another seventy years before the British Medical Association in 1889 reported that rickets was rarely seen in the rural districts of the British Isles but was prevalent in large industrialized towns, suggesting that lack of sun exposure was responsible for the high incidence of rickets. </p> <p>A year later, a British doctor collected clinical observations from a number of his colleagues throughout the British Empire and the Orient and found that rickets abounded in the industrialized centers of Great Britain, whereas the impoverished cities of China, Japan, and India, where people lived in squalor and had poor nutrition, were spared from this bone-deforming disease. But like Dr. Sniadecki, this early visionary&#x2019;s findings weren&#x2019;t taken seriously. Although the exact relationship between sunlight and bone development was not yet understood, a health movement was pioneered by Arnold Rikli at the end of the 1800s with this motto: &#x201c;Water works wonders, air can do even more, but [sun] light works best of all.&#x201d; </p><p>It was difficult for the scientific community to embrace the concept that the simple remedy of exposure to sunlight could cure this bone-de- forming disease, and little was done to use these insightful observations for the prevention and cure of rickets. When scientists began investigating the connection between sunlight and health, it was initially believed that the warmth generated by the sun conferred the health benefits. It was Sir Eve- rard Home, who, in the late 1700s and early 1800s, deduced that it wasn&#x2019;t the heat of the sun&#x2019;s radiation but rather the occurrence of a chemical effect on the body caused by the sun that produced sunburn. Home also showed that dark-skinned people had a natural resistance to sunburn. </p><p>By 1900, it was estimated that 80 percent of the children living in the industrialized cities of northern Europe and the northeastern United States were afflicted with rickets. Almost one hundred years after Dr. Sniadecki&#x2019;s first report, a German physician by the name of Kurt Huldschinsky reported that exposure to ultraviolet radiation from a mercury arc lamp was an effective method of curing patients with severe rickets. He cleverly demonstrated that the effect of phototherapy was not a direct effect on the skeleton, inasmuch as exposure of one arm had an equal and dramatic effect on the cure of rickets in both arms. People thought he was nuts for irradiating sick kids with a mercury arc lamp (mind you, this was long before skin cancer became part of the conversation), but some took his idea to heart. Two years later, in 1921, two New York doctors (Hess and Unger) exposed eight children suffering from rickets to sunlight on the rooftop of a New York City hospital. They showed through X-ray examination marked improvement in each child. Finally, the scientific community was ready to listen. </p><p>In the early 1930s, the U.S. government set up an agency that recom- mended to parents that they put their children outside for a reasonable amount of sun exposure. Several manufacturers also began to produce ultraviolet (UV) lamps that were then sold in local pharmacies through- out the 1930s, &#x2019;40s, and &#x2019;50s. I know, difficult to believe given today&#x2019;s attitude on ultraviolet radiation. </p> <br><b><p>Heliotherapy Takes Hold </p></b><p>By the beginning of the twentieth century, scientists had determined that it was the UV radiation in sunlight that stimulated the production of vitamin D in the human body. They deduced th...</p></p><h2>Guide to North American Steam Locomotives</h2><p>This book has the fascinating history and development of steam locomotives in North American.

Escaping over the orphanage wall to explore the outside world, Mandy discovers a tiny deserted cottage in the woods. All through the spring, summer, and fall, Mandy works to make it truly hers. Sometimes she "borrows" things she needs from the orphanage. Sometimes, to guard her secret, she even lies. Then, one stormy night at the cottage, Mandy gets sick, and no one knows how to find her&#x2014;except a special friend she didn't know she had.</p><p>This is the perfect book for ten-year-old girls who love tiny houses and stories filled with hope. </p></p><p>For an orphan child whose life is filled with comfortable, predictable sameness, with no particular hardships, life is, well, all right. Really, what does Mandy have to worry about? So it comes as a surprise even to Mandy when a small restlessness begins to grow in her. This lonely ache sets her to wandering farther afield, and leads her to a startling and wonderful discovery over the orphanage wall--a very old, very small, seemingly abandoned cottage. Embarking on a clandestine domestic fantasy involving gardening tools and soap flakes, Mandy finds herself being less than honest about where and how she's spending her days. Holding her secret closer and closer to her heart, this imaginative dreamer inadvertently endangers her reputation--and her life.<p> For every child who has fallen in love with <i>The Secret Garden</i> or <i>A Little Princess</i>, Julie Andrews Edwards's 1971 novel will be a heartwarming discovery. Any sometimes-lonely child with a giant imagination will recognize Mandy's dreams and rejoice in her ultimate fairy-tale happy ending. Judith Gwyn Brown's Edward Gorey-esque pen and ink drawings (with none of Gorey's sinister air) are quietly memorable. Fans of Julie Andrews Edwards--<i>Sound of Music</i> star of stage and screen--will be thrilled to see her latest children's book, <i>Little Bo: The Story of Bonnie Boadicea</i>, or to an earlier favorite, <i>The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles</i>.

Ms. Andrews reads her delightful story with a keen ability to convey the world as glimpsed through the eyes of a child - capturing the flights of fantasy that brighten all of our dreamy afternoons.</p><h2>Nutritional Lithium: A Cinderella Story: The Untold Tale of a Mineral That Transforms Lives and Heals the Brain</h2><p><p>In a nation plagued with chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes, a different predator is the single greatest reason for disability in the United States: mental disorders.</p> <p>Our fast-paced and frenetic lifestyle, coupled with a grossly polluted environment, has created the perfect breeding ground for mental instability. With the spread of brain disorders on the rise around the world, nutritional biochemistry and one of its stars, lithium, has stepped into the spotlight to offer proven methods to heal our bodies from the inside out.</p> <p>Historically linked to severe psychiatric illness, lithium as an agent of good health and well-being is often ignored and brushed aside. Known as the Cinderella drug, it is an essential mineral in our physical and psychological makeup. Lack of its presence in the body can result in poor brain development, psychiatric symptoms, and so on. When administered in small, controlled doses, lithium can significantly improve the lives of those suffering from mental disorders.</p> <p><i>Nutritional Lithium: A Cinderella Story</i> illustrates the significance of this precious mineral not only as a nutrient vital to human development, but also as a nutritional component that can help millions of people worldwide.</p></p><p><p>James M.

Yet, every five seconds someone in the world goes blind. Most causes of visual impairment are caused by age-related diseases such as cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy. Modern medicine has no cure for these conditions. Treatment usually involves managing the symptoms and attempting to slow the progression of the disease. In some cases surgery is an option, but there is always the danger of adverse side effects that can damage the eyes even further. Most chronic progressive eye disorders are considered incurable, hopeless. However, there is a successful treatment. It doesn&#x2019;t involve surgery, drugs, or invasive medical procedures. All that is needed is a proper diet. The key to this diet is coconut, specifically coconut oil. The author used this method to cure is own glaucoma, something standard medical therapy is unable to do. The coconut based dietary program described in this book has the potential to help prevent and treat many common visual problems including the following: Cataracts Glaucoma Macular degeneration Diabetic retinopathy Dry eye syndrome Sjogren&#x2019;s syndrome Optic neuritis Irritated eyes Conjunctivitis (pink eye) Stroke Eye disorders related to neurodegenerative disease (Alzheimer&#x2019;s, Parkinson&#x2019;s, MS) Most chronic eye disorders come without warning. No one can tell who will develop a visual handicap as they age. Everybody is at risk. Once the disease is present, treatment is a lifelong process. The best solution is prevention. In this book, you will learn the basic underlying causes for the most common degenerative eye disorders and what you can do to prevent, stop, and even reverse them.</p><p></p><h2>Paper Automata: Four Working Models to Cut Out and Glue Together</h2><p>A bravura display of imagination by Rob Ives has produced this delightful collection of working automata to cut out and make. As you operate the mechanisms, the Hopping Sheep hop energetically and the Pecking Hen pecks keenly into its feeder. The rather sad Motley Man bows and acknowledges the applause he has earned and while The Flying Fish does not actually fly, it does flap its wings and undulate in a delightfully unexpected manner. Each of the mechanisms uses a different principle to generate motion, so this book is of special interest to those who like to see what remarkable things can be achieved with paper.</p><p></p><h2>Statistics in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference</h2><p><p>Need to learn statistics for your job?

Full of high-rise government housing, low-income apartment complexes, and derelict single-family homes on tiny lots strewn with garbage, Ward Eight had been the second most dangerous ward in the District behind Ward Seven, but it had recently retaken the lead thanks to a triple murder in the last week of the reporting period.</p><p>But despite the late hour and the area&#x2019;s infamous reputation, a lone pedestrian ambled calmly through the misty evening, heading north on Atlantic Street SE as if he didn&#x2019;t have a care in the world. He walked along a broken sidewalk, catching the glow of most all of the streetlamps that had not been shot out or burned out and left black by a city that didn&#x2019;t give a damn about its poorest residents. He wore blue jeans and a wrinkled blue blazer, his dark brown hair was tousled and damp, and a clean-shaven face revealed him as white, which, around here, at this time of night, meant he was probably up to no good.</p><p>It was ten p.m., and the neighborhood appeared devoid of any life other than the solo pedestrian. But while the street itself was barren, several sets of eyes tracked the man&#x2019;s movements. Astonished senior citizens looked out from behind their barred apartment windows. A single mother up with a sick kid watched through the bolted Plexiglas door of her duplex unit with a wince of regret, knowing good and well the damn fool in the street was going to get rolled at best and murdered at worst. And a teen with a cell phone on a darkened stoop of an apartment building watched the man carefully, reporting what he saw to an acquaintance at the other end of the connection with hopes of collecting a finder&#x2019;s fee if his friend showed up with a crew and beat every last item of value off of the hapless outsider.</p><p>But the teen and his friend were out of luck, because another group of predators were closer, and they also had their eyes on this target of opportunity.</p><p>Three dark silhouettes watched the white man from where they stood in a driveway, in front of a fifty-five-gallon drum filled with burning trash.</p><p>Marvin was the oldest of the three, and at thirty-one he had eleven priors, most for B&amp;E or armed robbery. Only two arrests had really stuck, the first one earning him eleven months, twenty-nine days in a city lockup. And then, on the inside, Marvin had bought himself a full dime at Hagerstown for manslaughter.</p><p>He did six years before being released on good behavior&#x2014;a relative term in prison&#x2014;and now he was back on the streets.</p><p>And he wasn&#x2019;t looking for work. He was looking for a score.</p><p>In this pursuit he had taken on the two young men with him. Darius and James were both sixteen, and they looked up to the older Marvin since he&#x2019;d done time and he&#x2019;d killed a man, and because of this they would follow him anywhere. For Marvin&#x2019;s part, he liked running a crew of kids because they could take chances; any convictions they earned would likely be expunged on their eighteenth birthdays.</p><p>Marvin carried a handgun in his waistband under his baggy boxers. It was a rusty Lorcin Arms L380, a piece of junk, even compared to the other pot-metal pistols ubiquitous on the low end of crime here in the &#x201c;gun-free zone&#x201d; of D.C. He&#x2019;d never shot the weapon, it was for show, really, which meant he kept the grip of the gun on display, sticking out from below his faux leather jacket, but only when the cops weren&#x2019;t around. If he saw a patrol car a couple of shakes would drop the little automatic down the inside of his warm-up pants and out onto the ground. He could then kick it away or under something, or else he could just fucking run.</p><p>Marvin had been running from trouble since long before the two boys standing with him were born.</p><p>The two kids had thin switchblades they&#x2019;d shoplifted from a head shop in Hyattsville. The knives were comically cheap novelty items, but the boys didn&#x2019;t know any better and they thought themselves impossibly badass for carrying them inside their jackets.</p><p>Darius and James fingered their knives under their clothes as they watched the white man disappear in the mist, just past an overgrown hedge strewn with blown trash. As one they turned to each other, smiling in surprise at this evening&#x2019;s outrageous fortune. The pedestrian seemed oblivious to the fact he&#x2019;d just walked past the three men standing by the fire, which made them think the fool was drunk, high, or perhaps a combination of both. Even though they rarely saw whites walking around this section of Washington Highlands at night, men and women of all races certainly drove into this neighborhood to buy drugs all the time, especially at night, and the two boys couldn&#x2019;t imagine any reason for this fool&#x2019;s presence other than a buy.</p><p>That meant he either had cash or drugs, and it didn&#x2019;t matter which, because around here, drugs were cash.</p><p>Darius and James looked back over the flames coming out of the oil drum, towards their leader.</p><p>Marvin nodded back to his crew, giving them the prompting they needed. All three left the warmth of the drum and headed down the driveway to the sidewalk, following the white man with their hands hovering inches from the weapons they kept tucked inside their clothes.</p><p>At the same instant three hunters were stalking their prey on 8th Street SE, a twenty-four-million-dollar Eurocopter streaked high over D.C., flying from Maryland in the northeast and heading towards Virginia in the southwest. The men on board discussed the chances someone below them was lining up the advanced optical sights of a man-portable surface-to-air missile on the tail rotor behind them, or perhaps tracking the nose of the helo with the iron sights of a rocket-propelled grenade launcher. Onboard countermeasures were ready, the pilot made defensive maneuvers, and all eyes were focused outside the helo and down at street level, scanning for the bright flare of a missile launch.</p><p>But there was no flare and there was no launch, because although the man they feared was, in fact, somewhere below them, he had no SAM, nor did he have an RPG.</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t even have a pistol or, for that matter, any cash.</p><p>Court Gentry walked alone through D.C.&#x2019;s most dangerous district, as aware of the footsteps closing on him as he was of the throbbing in his right forearm and the maddening itch under the plaster cast that went from his elbow to his wrist.</p><p>He knew three men were following him&#x2014;a definite leader and two subordinates, much younger and completely subservient to their boss. Gentry determined all this from a quarter-second half glance as he passed them on the driveway, as well as from the sounds of their footfalls. The man in the middle was more sure, the men on either side uneasy, slowing from time to time, then rushing to catch back up to the one in charge.</p><p>Court knew something about the psychology of crime. These street thugs weren&#x2019;t looking for a fight; they were looking for a victim. The strength of the attackers&#x2019; resolve would be reflected in how quickly they acted. If they messed around and followed him for blocks, then they would probably never go through with it. On the other hand, if they challenged him right now, that meant their confidence was high and they wouldn&#x2019;t be expecting any resistance, and this would indicate to Gentry they were probably armed and they&#x2019;d done this sort of thing before.</p><p>Just then, still half a block from the next intersection, the man in the middle of the three called out.</p><p>&nbsp;&#x201c;Yo! You know what this is. You don&#x2019;t gotta get hurt.&#x201d;</p><p>Court was pleased this guy was getting right to it. After all, he didn&#x2019;t have all night. He stopped, but he did not turn around. He just stood there, facing away. The three men behind came closer.</p><p>&#x201c;Turn around, motherfucker. Do it slow.&#x201d;</p><p>Court took a few calming breaths, but he did not turn.</p><p>&#x201c;Yo, bitch! I&#x2019;m talkin&#x2019; to you!&#x201d;</p><p>Now Court slowly pivoted to face the threat.</p><p>The three attackers stood only six feet away on the sidewalk. Court scanned their eyes. It was always the same in a threat situation. Determine the will, and determine the skill. He pegged the leader as cocky, amped up from excitement, but not from concern. The other two tried to show confidence, but their furtive eyes sold them out.</p><p>All three clutched weapons. The leader had a small gunmetal blue pistol and the two men with him&#x2014; actually now to Court they appeared to be teenagers&#x2014;each held up a knife.</p><p>Court spoke calmly. &#x201c;Evenin&#x2019;, gents.&#x201d;</p><p>The leader cocked his head in surprise. After a second, the thin black man said, &#x201c;I want that wallet. And that phone.&#x201d; He looked around on the street, then asked, &#x201c;Where your car at?&#x201d;</p><p>Court ignored the man&#x2019;s voice and focused on the pistol in his hand. &#x201c;What do you have there?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a gun, motherfucker!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right. What kind of gun?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The kinda gun that&#x2019;s gonna pop a cap in your ass if you don&#x2019;t pull out that wallet and drop it off, real nice and slow.&#x201d;</p><p>The man raised the pistol to eye level, in Court&#x2019;s face now. Even though the light was bad, Court was able to identify the weapon quickly here, just three feet from the tip of his nose.</p><p>He sighed. Disappointed. &#x201c;An L380? What the hell am I supposed to do with that piece of shit?&#x201d;</p><p>The armed man stiffened his gun arm, then smiled. &#x201c;Oh, I got it. You tryin&#x2019; to die tonight.&#x201d;</p><p>Court looked around at the two others. &#x201c;Any chance you kids are strapped?&#x201d; The boys glanced at their boss, confused. After a second they held their knives up higher. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d; Court looked up into the wet sky with a half smile. &#x201c;Just my luck.&#x201d;</p><p>Marvin had been pointing guns at people since before his thirteenth birthday, and in all this time he&#x2019;d never seen anyone so utterly unimpressed. Normally eyes widened to saucers and fixed on the muzzle of his weapon, and no matter what he did for the rest of the encounter, the person at gunpoint never ever glanced away from the instrument in his hand. They rarely even blinked.</p><p>But this guy turned to the other men, looked around at the street, into the sky, and at the windows of the duplexes all around. He didn&#x2019;t seem at all concerned that there was a motherfucking gat in his motherfucking face.</p><p>The white man didn&#x2019;t look high, and he didn&#x2019;t smell drunk. His languid eyes were clear, his relaxed body did not sway. For some reason he just didn&#x2019;t give a damn.</p><p>And this infuriated Marvin. He had no plan B for intimidating a victim.</p><p>The two boys stepped to either side of their prey. Now Marvin had a pistol pointed to the man&#x2019;s forehead, and his crew had stilettos in range on the left and right.</p><p>But the white man wasn&#x2019;t worried about the knives, either. He just sighed more deeply now, his shoulders slumped all the way down. &#x201c;Any chance I can persuade you guys to step off? I don&#x2019;t have any cash, no phone, no car. I don&#x2019;t have a thing to offer you but trouble, and I promise you, I&#x2019;m a lot more trouble than I&#x2019;m worth. What do you say we call it a night and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Marvin was tired of this asshole. He stepped forward a half step, raising the gun higher to drive his point home. As he did so the white man&#x2019;s left hand shot up and forward and he spun on his left foot in a blur, pirouetting his body out of the line of fire. Marvin was stunned by the movement. As the man turned, his strong hand locked onto the slide of the pistol, just aft of the muzzle, and he shoved the weapon to the side and down. Marvin instinctively pulled the trigger. The Lorcin cracked loud in the empty street, but the white man had both rotated his body away to Marvin&#x2019;s right and pushed the gun down low to Marvin&#x2019;s left just as it fired.</p><p>Marvin realized instantly he had missed.</p><p>James leapt into the air, the stiletto dropped to the ground as he grabbed at his lower leg with both hands. He fell into the grass by the sidewalk and wailed.</p><p>The kid had taken the .380 hollow-point round through the top of his foot.</p><p>Marvin knew he had fucked up, but he still had the gun in his hand, and for some inexplicable reason, his intended victim released his hold of the weapon. The man turned away from Marvin now, his attention on Darius and his blade, leaving his back exposed, just a couple of feet from Marvin&#x2019;s gun.</p><p>Marvin couldn&#x2019;t believe this fool could be so stupid as to let go of a loaded gun and then turn his back on it. Marvin raised the weapon and pointed it at the back of the fool&#x2019;s head, ready to kill the man before he did anything to Darius. He pulled the trigger.</p><p>Click.</p><p>Court ignored the asshole with the gun behind him because he knew the man was out of the fight for the next few seconds. By grabbing the slide of the weapon, Court had kept it from cycling after it fired. Now there was a spent shell inside the chamber of the Lorcin, and the dude behind him could pull that trigger all damn day and it wouldn&#x2019;t go bang, not until he racked the slide to eject the spent casing and load a fresh round from the magazine.</p><p>And Court didn&#x2019;t think for an instant he would figure this out for at least a couple of seconds.

The Hylands bring an eclectic flair to some of America&#x2019;s favorite foodstuffs . . . culled&nbsp;from their restaurant menus, but designed for home kitchens.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i>&nbsp;(starred review)</b></p><p>Before she was one of New York&#x2019;s favorite restaurateurs,&nbsp;<b>Emily Hyland</b>&nbsp;was an English teacher, a yoga instructor, and a poet. After meeting her husband, Matt, during college in Rhode Island, her early love of great food (especially pizza!) blossomed and they opened the restaurants Emily, Emmy Squared, and Emily West Village.&nbsp;<b>Matt Hyland</b>&nbsp;is Emily restaurant&#x2019;s chef and creator of the recipes that have made it famous. A native of Connecticut, a state where excellent pizza is a way of life, Matt came to his appreciation of great pies at an early age. After training at a variety of restaurants in New York, he perfected his craft as a pizzaiolo, and developed a unique approach to making American pizza with timeless techniques. Emily and Matt live in Brooklyn where they make and eat lots of pizza.Chapter 1<br><br>Small Plates<br><br>To start your meal at EMILY, we offer a rotating selection of dishes that will set the stage for the food to come. Knowing that the main courses will no doubt be indulgent, we keep these small plates on the lighter side, and mostly vegetable-driven. We like to offer highly seasonal vegetables when we can to highlight offerings from local purveyors such as Myers Produce or small, emerging greenhouses like Farm One. From our experience eating at lots of pizza restaurants over the years, salads and small plates often feel overlooked or play second-fiddle to the pizza; we prefer to make our best versions of these items to shine just as brightly as everything else on our menu. To help accomplish this, we use unexpected ingredients and flavors, with a bent towards Matt&#x2019;s affinity for Asian cuisine. And even though some pizza restaurants also have chicken wings on their menu, we wager that they are nothing like our customer favorite, Nguyen&#x2019;s Hot Wings, cloaked in a sticky spicy sauce.<br><br>Marinated Olives with Lemon and Fennel<br><br>Makes 8 servings<br><br>Olives, lemons, and garlic have grown side-by-side for centuries in the Mediterranean region, so it is no surprise that they go so well together. It&#x2019;s worth making a large batch, as they keep for a couple weeks in the fridge. While this method works with other varieties, the Castelvetrano variety, with their mild flavor and plump flesh, is our absolute favorite out of a wide range of olive options.<br><br>2/3 cup (165 ml) extra-virgin olive oil, or more as needed<br><br>2/3 cup (165 ml) canola oil<br><br>3 garlic cloves, crushed under a knife and peeled<br><br>1 teaspoon fennel seeds<br><br>1 teaspoon black peppercorns<br><br>1 bay leaf<br><br>3 strips lemon zest, removed with a vegetable peeler, about 3 inches (7.5 cm) long<br><br>3 strips lime zest, removed with a vegetable peeler, about 3 inches (7.5 cm) long<br><br>1 pound (455 g) Castelvetrano olives<br><br>1. Warm the olive oil, canola oil, garlic, fennel seeds, peppercorns, bay leaf, lemon zest, and lime zest in a small saucepan over very low heat until tiny bubbles appear around the garlic and zest strips, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool for 10 minutes. Pour the olives into a large bowl, add the contents of the saucepan, and mix well.<br><br>2. Transfer the mixture to a container with a lid. If the oil does not cover the olives, add more olive oil as needed. Cover and refrigerate overnight.<br><br>3. To serve, use a slotted spoon to transfer the olives and any clinging ingredients to a serving bowl. Let stand for about 30 minutes, and serve at room temperature. (The olives can be refrigerated for up to 2 weeks.)<br><br>Shishito Peppers with Sichuan Oil and Pecorino<br><br>Makes 4 to 6 servings<br><br>Part of the fun of eating shisto peppers is that only one out of ten is really spicy. This phenomenon occurs because the peppers facing the sun while growing turn out to be the spiciest. We play up the heat with a drizzle of our brick-red Sichuan oil and then balance it with the salty sharpness of pecorino Romano cheese and a splash of fish sauce. Cook these outside on the grill for a bit of smoky flavor, or just roast them in a hot oven for similar results.<br><br>8 ounces (225 g) shishito peppers<br><br>2 teaspoons canola oil<br><br>2 teaspoons Sichuan Oil (page 208)<br><br>2 teaspoons Vietnamese fish sauce, preferably Three Crabs (see below)<br><br>Pecorino Romano in a chunk, for grating<br><br>Special equipment: Large handful of oak or maple wood chips<br><br>1. Prepare an outdoor grill for indirect grilling over high heat (500�F/260�C). Sprinkle the dry wood chips over the coals of a charcoal grill or into the smoker box of a gas grill. (Or position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 500�F/260�C.)<br><br>2. Toss the peppers with the canola oil and spread in a large, heavy skillet, preferably cast iron. When the wood starts smoking, add the skillet to the cooler area of the grill and close the lid. (Or place the skillet in the oven.) Cook, without turning, until the peppers are lightly browned, 7 to 10 minutes.<br><br>3. Remove the skillet from the grill (or oven). Drizzle the Sichuan oil and fish sauce over the peppers. Grate a shower of Romano over the peppers to lightly cover them (about 2 tablespoons), and serve immediately, directly from the skillet.<br><br>Fish sauce It would be almost impossible to make Southeast Asian food without fish sauce. Called nuoc mam in Vietnam and nam pla in Thailand, there are also Japanese, Korean, and Indonesian versions. Interestingly, while fish sauce tends to be associated with Asian cuisine, it has been traditionally used in Roman cooking as well; Matt finds it indispensable in most of our pasta dishes, where it works in tandem with tomatoes and cheese to deliver its umami punch. Our favorite is the Viet Huong brand; we also like the Three Crabs variety. Look for the three crustaceans on the label.<br><br>Smoky Carrots with Beluga Lentils and Tahini Dressing<br><br>Makes 6 servings<br><br>With bold contrasting colors of orange carrots and black lentils, this dish works well as an appetizer, on a buffet table, or even at a picnic, where it is delicious at ambient temperature. It&#x2019;s best with organic carrots, preferably from the farmer&#x2019;s market, perhaps with a mixture of orange, yellow, and purple rainbow carrots. We love beluga lentils because they offer an al dente texture compared to other lentils and a subtle bed of flavor to the smokiness of the carrots. Like all of our oven-roasted dishes, this one can be cooked on the grill or in the oven.<br><br>Tahini Dressing<br><br>2 tablespoons tahini<br><br>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice<br><br>1 or 2 cloves Garlic Confit (page 215), mashed with a fork into a pur�e<br><br>11/2 tablespoons water, as needed<br><br>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br><br>1/2 cup (110 g) beluga (also called black or caviar) lentils, sorted for debris, rinsed, and drained<br><br>Kosher salt<br><br>12 thin carrots with tops (about 1 lb/455 g)<br><br>Extra-virgin olive oil<br><br>Ground sumac (see page 6), for serving<br><br>Fresh mint sprigs for garnish<br><br>Special equipment: Large handful of oak or maple wood chips<br><br>1. To make the dressing: Whisk the tahini, lemon juice, and garlic confit in a small bowl. Whisk in enough water to make a thick but pourable dressing. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set the dressing aside.<br><br>2. Put the lentils in a medium saucepan and add enough water to cover by 2 inches (5 cm). Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook the lentils at a steady simmer, uncovered, until tender, about 30 minutes. During the last few minutes, add 1 teaspoon salt. Drain well and set the lentils aside.<br><br>3. Prepare an outdoor grill for indirect grilling over high heat (500�F/260�C). (Or position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 500�F/260�C.)<br><br>4. Trim and discard the carrot greens, leaving a nub of stems at the top of each. Toss the carrots with 1 tablespoon olive oil on a rimmed baking sheet (or, for grilling, in a shallow disposable aluminum foil pan).<br><br>5. Sprinkle the dry wood chips over the coals of a charcoal grill or into the smoker box of a gas grill. Roast the carrots over indirect heat on the grill, with the lid closed, or in the oven, until they are barely tender when pierced with the tip of a small knife, about 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. If you wish, cool the carrots to room temperature.<br><br>6. Drizzle with olive oil and season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide the lentil mixture among individual single-serving skillets or shallow salad bowls. Arrange the carrots on top and add a dollop of the tahini to each. Sprinkle with the sumac and add another splash of olive oil. Finish each with a mint sprig. Serve warm or at room temperature.<br><br>Oki Roasted Broccoli<br><br>Makes 4 to 6 servings<br><br>This simple roasted broccoli benefits from a punch of flavorful Japanese accents. The amounts for this recipe are loose&#x2014;we&#x2019;re really talking about drizzles, and handfuls instead of precise amounts. Use the measurements for garnishes as guidelines, keeping in mind that you&#x2019;re going for harmony and not one overriding flavor. The oki approach works with other roasted vegetables, too, so feel free to swap something else for the broccoli&#x2014;we serve roasted delicata squash in this preparation during fall.<br><br>12 ounces (340 g) broccoli florets, each about 1 inch across<br><br>2 teaspoons Asian sesame oil (see sidebar)<br><br>Kosher salt<br><br>2 tablespoons Kewpie mayonnaise (see Box), in its squeeze bottle<br><br>1 tablespoon okonomiyaki sauce (see Box), in its squeeze bottle<br><br>1 teaspoon ground green seaweed (aonori; see Box)<br><br>2 heaping tablespoons bonito flakes (see Box)<br><br>Special equipment: Large handful of apple or cherry wood chips soaked in water for at least 30 minutes<br><br>1. Prepare an outdoor grill for indirect grilling over high heat (500�F/260�C). Sprinkle the dry wood chips over the coals of a charcoal grill or into the smoker box of a gas grill. (Or position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 500�F/260�C.)<br><br>2. Toss the broccoli with the sesame oil in a large ovenproof skillet, preferably cast iron. Spread the broccoli out in the skillet and grill (or roast) until the broccoli is lightly browned and crisp-tender, about 10 minutes. Season the broccoli lightly with salt.<br><br>3. Remove the skillet from the grill (or oven). Squeeze zigzags of the mayonnaise and Okonomiyaki sauce over the broccoli. Sprinkle with the seaweed, followed by the bonito. Serve immediately, as the bonito flakes will twist and turn from the radiated heat, which is part of the fun of eating this dish.<br><br>About Japanese Ingredients<br><br>At EMILY, we use a plethora of Japanese ingredients. Here are some of our favorites, for which the recipes in this book often call.<br><br>Toasted sesame oil is dark and has the distinct aroma of toasted sesame seeds. Avoid the pale yellow domestic sesame oil (usually labeled as expeller-pressed), as it doesn&#x2019;t have the desired nutty taste.<br><br>Okonomiyaki sauce is thick and glossy, with a variety of fruits and vegetables to give it a sweet note. It&#x2019;s named for okonomiyaki, a kind of savory pancake that can be filled with just about anything. In fact, okonomi translates to &#x201c;your favorite things&#x201d; and yaki means &#x201c;grill.&#x201d; The traditional toppings are squiggles of this sauce (which may remind you of a combination of Worcestershire sauce and ketchup) and Kewpie mayonnaise (see below). <br><br>Aonori is neon-green seaweed that has been ground into tiny flakes. It is used as a seasoning sprinkled over food.<br><br>Bonito flakes (also called katsuobushi) are tissue-thin slices of fermented and dried skipjack tuna with an intense marine flavor. They are usually steeped in hot water to make dashi, a classic Japanese broth (but not for our version on page 18). We like to sprinkle the flakes on top of hot foods, where the flakes look like they are coming alive, twisting and turning from the heat waves rising from the food. When purchasing, be sure to choose the larger flakes in large bags and not the smaller packaged ones that used to make &#x201c;instant&#x201d; dashi.<br><br>Kewpie mayonnaise is a Japanese brand that is creamier and tangier than American mayo, and it is flavored with both malt and rice wine vinegars. You&#x2019;ll find it at Asian markets in a distinctive clear plastic squeeze bottle with a red flip top.<br><br>Kombu is thick, somewhat leathery seaweed that is used to make dashi, the basic cooking stock in Japanese cuisine. It comes in flat sheets that are sometimes dried into crumpled ropes. The powdery white coating on the surface of the kombu is glutamate, which gives the seaweed its special flavor. Do not rinse or wipe off the powder, regardless of conflicting advice in old Japanese cookbooks. (In the past, the seaweed could have dirt or sand clinging to it, but that rarely happens now.) To judge the amount of kombu you&#x2019;ll need, weigh it on a kitchen scale, or use the weight on the package as an estimate. A little more or less won&#x2019;t make much difference.<br><br>Dried shiitake mushrooms are used in both Japanese and Chinese cooking. Simmering them in liquid releases their earthy flavor. Use the entire mushroom; don&#x2019;t worry about removing the stems.<br><br>Panko is Japanese-style bread crumbs with a crisper, crunchier texture than its American or Italian counterparts.

Go!</h2><p>Reading goes to the dogs in this timeless Beginner Book edited by Dr. Seuss. From big dogs and little dogs to red, green, and blue dogs, dogs going up and dogs going fast . . . who knew dogs were so busy? And laughter will ensue at the repeated question &#x201c;Do you like my hat?&#x201d; Like P. D. Eastman&#x2019;s classic <i>Are You My Mother?</i> <i>Go, Dog. Go!</i> has been a go-to favorite for over fifty years, leaving audiences of all breeds wagging their tails with delight.<br><br> Originally created by Dr. Seuss, Beginner Books encourage children to read all by themselves, with simple words and illustrations&nbsp;that give clues to their meaning.<br><br>&nbsp;"The canine cartoons make an elementary text funny and coherent and still one of the best around."--<i>School Library Journal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><p>Life lessons? Romance? Literary instruction? <i>Go, Dog. Go!</i> offers all this and more, wrapped up in one simply worded, warmly hued package. Using single-syllable words in rhythmic repetition, and introducing colors and prepositions, this Seuss-styled classic has been an early favorite of children since 1961. For those looking for deeper meaning in a beginning reader book, here you'll find nothing less than a microcosm of life. Green dogs, yellow dogs, big dogs, little dogs. Dogs who prefer cars, dogs who favor skis. All represent the diversity a child will find in the world. And the slow-to-bud romance between the cheerfully oblivious yellow dog and the mincing pink poodle explains more succinctly than most self-help books what goes on in many grown-up relationships. Nonetheless, Eastman takes the concept of "primary" to heart, with his simple silly phrases and solidly colored illustrations. Not only will this book inspire peals of laughter in kids, it will also help them make the magical connection between those mysterious black squiggles on the page, and the words they hear and speak. <i>(Ages 4 to 8)</i>Illus. in full color.

She lives in Colorado Springs, Colorado.Gr 4-6-In the first book, each of the 10 amendments is quoted and explained. Sidebars expand on some; for example, the Sixth Amendment is accompanied by a brief look at the Miranda Statement. It's a good overview of one of our founding documents and will prepare readers for single titles such as those in "The Bill of Rights" series (ABDO, 2008). Taking the Common Core standard regarding "the relationship between a primary and secondary source" to heart, Magna Carta begins by defining primary and secondary sources and identifying the document as an important primary source. Baxter explains that the ideas expressed in the Magna Carta influenced the authors of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. A later section outlines some specific ways in which the liberties granted in it are incorporated into U.S. law. The books cited in the "Find Out More" section offer information on medieval life and the American Revolution, but not the Magna Carta itself. Despite a few minor flaws, this title may be of interest where the curriculum allows for a more thorough study of the history of U.S. founding documents. Most of Sonneborn's material is standard fare: an outline of the causes of the Revolutionary War, the initial failure of the Articles of Confederation, and the ultimately successful Constitutional Convention. Each of the seven articles is discussed, as is the Bill of Rights and later amendments. An explanation of primary and secondary sources includes a useful description of when and why a historian might use each type. In all of the books, maps, photographs, and reproductions of original documents add visual appeal.-Rebecca Donnelly, Rio Rancho Public Library, NM&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

An introductory spread presents "the cast," a helpful tool given the similarities among some of the names. The story of the handsome prince who encounters the forbidding Queen of the Night and endures three tests of his mettle before winning the hand of the lovely Pamina is told in simple prose, peppered with dialogue and occasional sound effects. Children raised on Disney will be attracted to the bright palette and the abundance of purple and pink, although Teis's painted papers and collages offer much more texture and design interest than those animated antecedents. The artist's ethnically diverse characters enrich the telling as well: each of the three servants to the Queen is portrayed with a different skin tone and hair quality, and the wise Sarastro sports flowing, ivory dreadlocks. Gatti's longer, more detailed presentation includes musical excerpts on an accompanying CD. The delightful "Mozart's Magic Fantasy" CD in the "Classical Kids" series (Children's Group, 1995) employs a contemporary character to help young listeners appreciate the composer's tale and glorious music. All three items have something unique to offer. Teis concludes with a brief note about Mozart, her childhood experience with his music, and extension ideas.&#x2014;<i>Wendy Lukehart, Washington DC Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In this immensely profitable book, Brian Borgman, a very sure-footed guide to this topic, biblically and precisely explains the concept of emotion and how it is to be integrated into one's walk with the Lord. I know of no other book quite like it. All at once, it is Scriptural, wise, clear, pastoral, transparent, and compelling. This is a great resource for instance, for a pastor who desires help in skillfully shepherding his sheep. It is also a wonderful help for a discipler and/or counselor who wants to instruct his disciples and counselees with their fears, worries, and anxieties. Even further, the principles in this work should prove to be of real, lasting value to any believer in Jesus who earnestly yearns to first grasp and then harness his or her own emotions within the context of a sensate culture that is quickly careening out of emotional control.

As his family moved across the United States, young Frank found his own home in shapes: rectangles, triangles, half-moons, and circles. When he returned to his beloved prairie, Frank pursued a career in architecture. But he didn't think the Victorian-era homes found there fit the prairie landscape. Using his knowledge and love of shapes, Frank created houses more organic to the land. He redesigned the American home inside and out, developing a truly unique architecture style that celebrated the country's landscape and lifestyle. Author Barb Rosenstock and artist Christopher Silas Neal explore the early life and creative genius of architect Frank Lloyd Wright, highlighting his passion, imagination, and ingenuity.</p><p>Barb Rosenstock is the author of many picture book biographies, including<i> Blue Grass Boy: The Story of Bill Monroe, Father of Bluegrass Music</i>; <i>Thomas Jefferson Builds a Library</i>;<i> Dorothea's Eyes</i>;<i> Ben Franklin's Big Splash;</i> and <i>The Streak: How Joe DiMaggio Became America's Hero</i>.

Nothing to worry about. Then you notice that the pain is getting worse, that you sometimes have trouble walking and jogging really hurts. Or perhaps there's a bit of "morning stiffness" in your hip, and it's a chore to go up and down the stairs. Something has to be done about this--you've got a life to live! You visit your doctor. The examination is routine, hardly more than a bit of probing. As you lie on the examination table in a paper dressing gown, the doctor moves your leg up and down and from side to side. "Does it hurt when I move your leg this way?" she asks. When you nod, she says, "Hmm. I'd like to order an X ray." The X ray shows an uneven narrowing of the joint space betweenthe bones of your right knee. Frowning as she studies the X ray, the doctor pronounces the diagnosis: "You have osteoarthritis. You know, 'wear and tear' arthritis. Osteoarthritis really starts ten to twenty years before you notice the first symptoms." "Why didn't you tell me twenty years ago about this so I could have stopped playing tennis on those hard courts and weekend football with my friends? What should I do now?" you ask anxiously. "Take aspirin or ibuprofen for the pain," she answers reassuringly. "And don't overexercise the knee." "But how did I get it?" "Osteoarthritis is practically inevitable," your doctor replies. "Almost everyone your age has it. The problem is the cartilage, which protects the ends of the bones. It's wearing away, and without that cartilage to keep your bones apart, they're grinding together, causing the pain and stiffness. That's essentially all there is to osteoarthritis. We can take care of the pain, up to a point, but unfortunately, there's nothing else we can do about it." <i>The Number-One Cause of Disability and Chronic Pain</i> Arthritis causes symptoms and problems in nearly 70 million Americans, or about one in every three adults.1 As the population ages and develops more obesity, diabetes, and joint injuries, this number will only increase. Right now, about 60 percent of Americans over age 65, or some 21 million people, have arthritis. That number is expected to double over the next few decades--by 2030, the number of older adults in the U.S. with arthritis or chronic joint pain will top 41 million. Arthritis doesn't just cause minor discomfort--it's the leading cause of disability among U.S. adults. In fact, arthritis accounts for some 17 percent of all disability nationwide. That's well ahead of heart disease, which is about 11 percent of all disability.2 Arthritis now limits everyday activities for more than 7 million Americans; by 2020, this number will increase to perhaps 12 million as the population ages. Disability from arthritis creates huge costs for those affected, their families, and the nation's economy. Each year, arthritis results in about$15 billion of direct medical costs for 44 million outpatient visits and 750,000 hospitalizations. The estimated total cost to society, including lost work productivity, is about $83 billion every year.3 Arthritis is not one disease, but a group of diseases whose common threads are that they cause pain, inflammation, limited movement, and destruction of the joints. Three out of five arthritis sufferers are under age 65--arthritis is not a disease just of the elderly. Though there are more than a hundred diseases that affect the musculoskeletal system, the most common form by far is osteoarthritis. In fact, osteoarthritis is more common than all other forms of arthritis combined. Because osteoarthritis is one of the forms of arthritis that becomes more common as we age, many people just assume it's a normal part of aging, that pain in the joints is like gray hair or wrinkles, something we should expect. But in fact, osteoarthritis usually starts in middle age or even earlier, often many years before a person first notices symptoms. In a joint afflicted with osteoarthritis, the cartilage that covers and cushions the ends of the bones degenerates, allowing bones to rub together. In addition, bone spurs and cysts may develop and the structures around the joint, such as tendons, ligaments, and muscles, may become strained, inflamed, and painful. The major symptom of osteoarthritis is pain; inflammation (swelling, redness, and warmth in the area) is usually a problem only later in the course of the disease. Often, however, osteoarthritis can occur without pain--the main symptom is that the affected joints become stiff and less flexible. Some people don't notice this loss of range of motion, because it tends to occur very gradually. For instance, you may not be able to turn your head to the side as easily as you could in the past while trying to back up your car. Even if you don't have any neck pain, this could be a sign of osteoarthritis in the upper spine. Up until recently, doctors in the United States thought that osteoarthritis was incurable. That's why the commonly prescribed treatment is strictly palliative, designed only to relieve the pain without addressing the true causes of the disease or the condition of the joints. For mild cases, doctors prescribe painkillers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol�) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such asaspirin or ibuprofen (Motrin�, Advil�). Steroid injections such as cortisone and opiates (narcotics) are reserved for the more resistant cases. Unfortunately, the painkillers and anti-inflammatories have problems. They temporarily relieve pain, but in the long run they simply cover up the symptoms while the disease progresses further. These drugs have side effects that range from the annoying to the downright dangerous--each year, thousands of people die from the adverse effects of anti-inflammatories, acetaminophen, and steroids. To add insult to injury, recent research suggests that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, including the new COX-2 inhibitors (such as Vioxx�, Celebrex�, and Bextra�),4 may actually cause certain features of osteoarthritis to progress faster.5,6,7 In addition, these new drugs can have other potentially serious side effects (see chapter 7 for more on this). So, after years of masking your pain with drugs while your disease becomes progressively more severe, you may have to call in a surgeon to replace your hips or knees with artificial ones. Even with the new joint, however, you don't have as much function as you did before your arthritis developed. Surgery is painful, expensive, and not permanent--in ten years or so the replacement will probably begin to fail and the operation will probably have to be redone. And every time you have surgery, there's always the risk of dying or becoming permanently disabled from complications. But as the doctor said, there's nothing else to be done for osteoarthritis. Or is there? <i>A New Approach Emerges</i> Instead of simply dulling arthritis pain with drugs or performing expensive and potentially dangerous surgery, many doctors today are actually <i>curing</i> the symptoms of osteoarthritis. How? With three safe, inexpensive, readily available dietary supplements: glucosamine, chondroitin, and a newly available supplement called ASU. These three supplements can be purchased without a prescription in almost any drug store or health-food store in America. The facts about this revolutionary but simple approach to solving a widespread problem are amazing: &#x2022; Since they are substances we already consume, and also produce in very small quantities in our bodies, glucosamine and chondroitin have no known significant side effects. This amazing fact stands in stark contrast to painkillers such as the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories and cortisone injections, which can wreak havoc on the body. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &#x2022; ASU, made from highly purified and concentrated fractions of avocado and soybean oil, is also safe and extremely well-tolerated. It has been used in France as a mainstay treatment for osteoarthritis for a number of years, with excellent results. Like glucosamine/chondroitin, ASU is now known to be the third, disease-improving treatment for osteoarthritis. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &#x2022; An extensive body of clinical research--decades' worth--proves that glucosamine/chondroitin and ASU work in both humans and animals. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &#x2022; Although these safe and effective therapies have long been used by physicians in Europe and elsewhere, they have been largely overlooked by the American medical community. Fortunately, this is starting to change. <i>We are now on the brink of a revolutionary improvement in the treatment of osteoarthritis and a revolutionary change in the way people think about this disease.</i> &nbsp; <br> The problem and its solution can be neatly summed up: Millions of Americans suffer from osteoarthritis, a painful and debilitating disease. Millions more are developing osteoarthritis now but do not yet have any symptoms. Osteoarthritis, the number-one cause of chronic pain, is one of the most widespread diseases in Western society. Although most physicians consider it to be incurable, osteoarthritis can actually be stopped in its tracks by using glucosamine/chondroitin and ASU. (These amazing natural substances may also be effective against other musculoskeletal conditions.) This astonishing information is well known and widely accepted in many other countries across the globe. The original edition of <i>The Arthritis Cure</i> brought the good news about glucosamine and chondroitin to the United States in 1997 and over 60 countries thereafter. Since then, these supplements have been widely accepted by most physicians, but some others still aren'tconvinced. They're concerned about accepting medical advances that come from abroad. After all, we have a wonderful medical system. If something is that good, shouldn't American doctors have thought of it first? Shouldn't they at least know about it? And what about quality control and scientific studies? Aren't they less rigorous outside the United States? American doctors may not like to admit it, but physicians in other countries are often ahead of us in many areas of medicine. The first heart transplant was performed in South Africa; the first "test tube" baby was born in England; France was a forerunner in the development of the AIDS drug AZT. Angioplasty (using a balloon to open clogged arteries) and coronary stents (devices used to hold the artery open after an angioplasty) originated in Europe and are more advanced there than they are in the United States. Medications in Europe are rigorously tested and regulated, just as they are here. In fact, many drugs widely used in the United States and two-thirds of drugs overall, such as omeprazole (Prilosec�), were developed overseas. We certainly have a good medical system, but it has traditionally been slow to accept new therapies or ideas. This is partially due to the federal Food and Drug Administration's decidedly unfriendly attitude toward the use of vitamins and other supplements for anything other than assuring that you meet your recommended daily nutritional requirements. And it's partially due to a relative lack of solid research into alternatives here in the United States. Indeed, a fair amount of the best scientific research on alternative approaches has been conducted in Germany and other European countries. The studies haven't all been translated into English, so they're not widely read by physicians here in the United States. Still, it's quite surprising that treatments used so successfully overseas for such a widespread and debilitating ailment have gone largely unnoticed in this country. Fortunately, that has started to change. <i>What Is Osteoarthritis?</i> The literal Greek translation of the word osteoarthritis is <i>osteo</i> (of the bone), <i>arthro</i> (joint), and <i>itis</i> (inflammation). But "bone/joint inflammation"may not be the most accurate description of osteoarthritis, since joint <i>pain</i> rather than inflammation is its most important characteristic. Indeed, while inflammation is a characteristic of many forms of arthritis, it is <i>not</i> found in most cases of osteoarthritis. This may be why some physicians feel that we should call the problem arthrosis, which means "degenerative joint disease." Osteoarthritis is just one of many forms of joint disease. It is, however, the most common form of arthritis, affecting the articular cartilage, the smooth, glistening, bluish-white substance attached to ends of the bones. (Have you ever looked at or touched the end of a chicken drumstick? That's articular cartilage.) In fact, articular cartilage is one of the smoothest substances known. In addition to the articular cartilage, osteoarthritis, called OA for short, affects several other areas in and around the joints. These include: &#x2022; the subchondral bone (the ends of the bones, where the cartilage is attached) &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &#x2022; the capsules that surround the joints &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &#x2022; the muscles adjacent to the joint &nbsp; <br> The pain of osteoarthritis comes not just from the damaged articular cartilage but from the rest of the joint and the area around it. That's why exercise to strengthen the muscles supporting the joint is a part of the arthritis cure (see chapter 8 for more about this). <i>Cartilage: The Focal Point of Osteoarthritis</i> Osteoarthritis begins in the cartilage, the rubbery, gel-like tissue found at the ends of bones. About 65 to 80 percent water, cartilage is designed to do two things: reduce the friction caused by one bone rubbing against another, and blunt the constant trauma inflicted on bones during everyday life. Think of healthy cartilage as being something like a sponge between the hard ends of the bones. This spongy material soaks up liquid (specifically, synovial fluid, the fluid found naturally in your joints) when the joint is at rest. When you move the joint and put pressureon it, the liquid is squeezed out again. For example, every time you take a step, your leg supports the pressure of your body weight. With each step, the cartilage in your knee joint is squeezed, forcing much of the synovial fluid out of it. But then when you pick up your foot to take another step, the fluid rushes back into the cartilage. The fluid "squishes" in and out as the cartilage responds to the constantly changing force exerted on the joint. Unlike a sponge, however, healthy cartilage does not flatten so easily. Filled with negatively charged <i>chondroitin</i> molecules that repel one another, increasing weight on the cartilage causes an increase in the repelling force. This is the same thing that happens when you try to push two magnets together that are trying to repel each other. It gets harder and harder to keep the magnets together the closer they are in proximity to each other. Over time, unfortunately, osteoarthritis can cause the loss of the chondroitin molecules and other cartilage components, eroding this protective buffer between the bones. As you'll learn in chapter 2, the problem has been growing in the cartilage matrix, the "birthplace" of cartil...</p><h2>Enchantress from the Stars</h2><p>Elana, a member of an interstellar civilization on a mission to a medieval planet, becomes the key to a dangerous plan to turn back an invasion.

But, all U.S. security personnel should read it. <b>Possibly the West's best treatise on Oriental warfare,</b> it sheds new light on what Asian infantry can do: (1) alternate between guerrilla, mobile, and positional warfare; (2) use "ordinary forces" to engage and "extraordinary forces [infiltrators]" to defeat; and then (3) retreat to save lives. What occurred in history doesn't change, but one's perception of it does--as he comes to better understand his former foe. Here's what really happened at Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima, Chosin Reservoir, and Hue City. Those who believe this book's cover art to be fantasy have only to google the term "dac cong." <b>Through how the NVA held their own without resupply, tanks, artillery, or air power, U.S. grunts could better survive the more lethal enemy weaponry of the 21st Century.</b></p><p>Unlike most other military books on the market, Phantom Soldier has the potential to save lives. For whatever reason, the U.S. military has only partially revealed to its lower echelons how Eastern armies fight at short range. Since WWI, American ground troops have entered combat expecting their opposition to have commensurate skills and similar maneuvers. This misperception has already cost many their lives. By revealing the pronounced trends in Eastern small-unit infantry tactics, Phantom Soldier shows U.S. service personnel how to win the guerrilla wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and more easily survive any larger conflict. With an in-depth look at several famous battles and over a hundred illustrations, this book has what it takes to entertain.<p>Lower-ranking U.S. service personnel will now have the same opportunity before entering combat that their Eastern European and Asian counterparts have had since WWI--to accurately predict what their adversaries will do.</p></p><h2>Mayor Kane: My Life in Wrestling and Politics</h2><p><b>The surprising story of how wrestling superstar Glenn "Kane" Jacobs beat all the odds to become the mayor of Knox County, Tennessee.</b><br>Even in his heyday in wrestling, Jacobs was inspired to pursue politics by popular libertarian figures such as former Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul, Republican Senator Rand Paul, Fox News' Judge Andrew Napolitano and others, and that led him to fulfill his own political ambitions.<br>Before becoming Mayor Kane, Glenn "Kane" Jacobs was one of WWE's top Superstars for over two decades and traveled the globe with the likes of "Stone Cold" Steve Austin, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, John Cena, Ric Flair, and many others.

In 2012, Myers was named National Ambassador for Young People's Literature.<b>From &#x201c;Black and White Together&#x201d;</b><br><br><i>Faced with diminishing adult support for protests in Birmingham, in 1963 Dr. King turned to the city&#x2019;s young people. James Bevel of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) suggested recruiting local students to participate, reasoning that since they did not have jobs to lose, they would be more willing to risk arrest. After being trained in the principles of nonviolence, more than one thousand African American students skipped their classes on May 2 and gathered in downtown Birmingham, marching directly into police lines to demand desegregation of local businesses, public facilities and restaurants. While hundreds were arrested and jailed, many more young people returned the next day to take their places. In the ensuing confrontation, T. Eugene &#x201c;Bull&#x201d; Connor, Birmingham&#x2019;s commissioner of public safety, ordered fire hoses and police dogs to be unleashed on the unarmed protestors. Here, Dr. King recounts the &#x201c;Children&#x2019;s Crusade&#x201d; and other important events that led to the end of segregation in Birmingham.</i><br><br>After eight days of imprisonment, Ralph Abernathy and I accepted bond to come out of jail for two purposes. It was necessary for me to regain communication with the S.C.L.C. officers and our lawyers in order to map the strategy for the contempt cases that would be coming up shortly in the circuit court. Also, I had decided to put into operation a new phase of our campaign, which I felt would speed victory. <br><br>I called my staff together and repeated a conviction I had been voicing ever since the campaign began. If our drive was to be successful, we must involve the students of the community. In most of the recent direct-action crusades, it had been the young people who sparked the movement. But in Birmingham, of the first four or five hundred people who had submitted themselves to arrest, two-thirds had been adults. We had considered this a good thing at the time, for a really effective campaign incorporates a cross section of the community. But now it was time to enlist the young people in larger numbers. Even though we realized that involving teenagers and high-school students would bring down upon us a heavy fire of criticism, we felt that we needed this dramatic new dimension. Our people were demonstrating daily and going to jail in numbers, but we were still beating our heads against the brick wall of the city officials&#x2019; stubborn resolve to maintain the status quo. Our fight, if won, would benefit people of all ages. But most of all we were inspired with a desire to give to our young a true sense of their own stake in freedom and justice. We believed they would have the courage to respond to our call.<br><br>James Bevel, Andy Young, Bernard Lee and Dorothy Cotton began visiting colleges and high schools in the area. They invited students to attend after-school meetings at churches. The word spread fast, and the response from Birmingham&#x2019;s youngsters exceeded our fondest dreams.<br><br>By the fifties and by the hundreds, these youngsters attended mass meetings and training sessions. They listened eagerly as we talked of bringing freedom to Birmingham, not in some distant time, but right now.<br>We taught them the philosophy of nonviolence. We challenged them to bring their exuberance, their youthful creativity, into the disciplined dedication of the movement. We found them eager to belong, hungry for participation in a significant social effort. Looking back, it is clear that the introduction of Birmingham&#x2019;s children into the campaign was one of the wisest moves we made. It brought a new impact to the crusade, and the impetus that we needed to win the struggle.<br><br>Immediately, of course, a cry of protest went up. Although by the end of April the attitude of the national press had changed considerably, so that the major media were according us sympathetic coverage, yet many deplored our &#x201c;using&#x201d; our children in this fashion. Where had these writers been, we wondered, during the centuries when our segregated social system had been misusing and abusing Negro children? Where had they been with their protective words when, down through the years, Negro infants were born into ghettos, taking their first breath of life in a social atmosphere where the fresh air of freedom was crowded out by the stench of discrimination?<br>The children themselves had the answer to the misguided sympathies of the press. One of the most ringing replies came from a child of no more than eight who walked with her mother one day in a demonstration. An amused policeman leaned down to her and said with mock gruffness: &#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d;<br><br>The child looked into his eyes, unafraid, and gave her answer. <br><br>&#x201c;F&#x2019;eedom,&#x201d; she said. <br><br>She could not even pronounce the word, but no Gabriel trumpet could have sounded a truer note.<br><br>Even children too young to march requested and earned a place in our ranks. Once when we sent out a call for volunteers, six tiny youngsters responded. Andy Young told them that they were not old enough to go to jail but that they could go to the library. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t get arrested there,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but you might learn something.&#x201d; So these six small children marched off to the building in the white district, where, up to two weeks before, they would have been turned away at the door. Shyly but doggedly, they went to the children&#x2019;s room and sat down, and soon they were lost in their books. In their own way, they had struck a blow, for freedom.<br>The children understood the stakes they were fighting for. I think of one teenage boy whose father&#x2019;s devotion to the movement turned sour when he learned that his son had pledged himself to become a demonstrator. The father forbade his son to participate.<br><br>&#x201c;Daddy,&#x201d; the boy said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to disobey you, but I have made my pledge. If you try to keep me home, I will sneak off. If you think I deserve to be punished for that, I&#x2019;ll just have to take the punishment. For, you see, I&#x2019;m not doing this only because I want to be free. I&#x2019;m doing it also because I want freedom for you and Mama, and I want it to come before you die.&#x201d;<br>That father thought again, and gave his son his blessing.<br><br>The movement was blessed by the fire and excitement brought to it by young people such as these. And when Birmingham youngsters joined the march in numbers, an historic thing happened. For the first time in the civil-rights movement, we were able to put into effect the Gandhian principle: &#x201c;Fill up the jails.&#x201d;<br>Jim Bevel had the inspiration of setting a &#x201c;D&#x201d; Day, when the students would go to jail in historic numbers. When that day arrived, young people converged on the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in wave after wave. Altogether on &#x201c;D&#x201d; Day, May 2, more than a thousand young people demonstrated and went to jail. At one school, the principal gave orders to lock the gates to keep the students in. The youngsters climbed over the gates and ran toward freedom. The assistant superintendent of schools threatened them with expulsion, and still they came, day after day. At the height of the campaign, by conservative estimates, there were 2,500 demonstrators in jail at one time, a large proportion of them young people.<br><br>Serious as they were about what they were doing, these teenagers had that marvelous humor that arms the unarmed in the face of danger. Under their leaders, they took delight in confusing the police. A small decoy group would gather at one exit of the church, bringing policemen streaming in cars and on motorcycles. Before the officers knew what was happening, other groups, by the scores, would pour out of other exits and move, two by two, toward our goal in the downtown section.<br><br>Many arrived at their destination before the police could confront and arrest them. They sang as they marched and as they were loaded into the paddy wagons. The police ran out of paddy wagons and had to press sheriff&#x2019;s cars and school buses into service.<br><br>Watching those youngsters in Birmingham, I could not help remembering an episode in Montgomery during the bus boycott. Someone had asked an elderly woman why she was involved in our struggle.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m doing it for my children and for my grandchildren,&#x201d; she had replied.<br><br>Seven years later, the children and grandchildren were doing it for themselves.</p><h2>Afrocentricity: The Theory of Social Change</h2><p><p>The central topic of this cross-disciplinary work is the theory of &#x201c;Afrocentricity,&#x201d; which mandates that Africans be viewed as subjects rather than objects; and looks at how this philosophy, ethos, and world view gives Africans a better understanding of how to interpret issues affecting their communities.

The title begins with some general information about ways in which naturalists observe nature, suggestions for keeping a journal, and places to explore. The sections are subdivided by habitat (ponds, meadows, beaches, lakes), and there's also an emphasis on ways to explore plant and wildlife in urban areas. The author covers a wide variety of topics that highlight seasonal changes. For instance, the section on "Winter" deals with "Life Under Ice," while "Autumn" discusses "Leaf Color." Page-long job descriptions scattered throughout delve into skills and interests needed for various nature-related occupations (horticulturist, taxonomist, botanical illustrator, and others). "Nature Activities," such as "Make Your Own Bug Spray" and "Build a Boat That Stays Afloat" using only materials readers can find at their feet, make learning fun. "Tips for Adult Caregivers" are also included.

You can see the veins in your wrist, and you've seen the scab that forms as a cut heals. But do you know what blood does for you? Without blood, you couldn't play, or grow, or learn. That's because just about every part of your body needs blood, from your muscles to your bones to your brain. How does your body use blood? Read and find out! </p><p> Ages 10 &#x2013; 14</p></p><p>Paul Showers wrote twenty books for the Let's-Read-and-Find-Out Science series, including favorites such as <em>What Happens to a Hamburger?</em> and <em>Where Does the Garbage Go?</em> Mr. Showers worked on the <em>Detroit Free Press,</em> the <em>New York Herald Tribune,</em> and for thirty years, the <em>Sunday New York Times. </em><br><br><p>Edward Miller has illustrated <em>A Drop of Blood</em> and <em>What Happens to a Hamburger?</em> for the Let's-Read-and-Find-Out Science series. He lives in New York City.</p>Kindergarten-Grade 3&#x2013;Showers's classic introduction to this vital fluid is cleverly updated by Miller's amusing illustrations featuring a Dracula-like vampire and his Igorish friend in place of the boy and dog who starred in the 1989 edition (o.p.). This change in characters is sure to be a hit with today's youngsters. The charismatic monsters demonstrate the role of blood in breathing, healing, and fueling the body. The predominance of purples and grays in both art and backgrounds creates an effective mood that is spooky and exciting without being scary. High-quality, close-up photographs of blood cells, platelets, and fibrin under the microscope are well placed within the illustrations, and science concepts are presented with just the right amount of detail for the intended audience. This is an excellent choice for units on the circulatory system or to take the fear out of cuts, scrapes, and blood tests.<i>&#x2013;Jenna Miller, Alachua County Library District, Gainesville, FL</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Every excuse, reason, and roadblock for not coming to Christ is examined and duly dealt with. If you think you may be too bad, or if perhaps you really are bad and you sin either openly or behind closed doors, you will discover that life in Christ is for you too. You can reject the message of salvation by faith, or you can choose to live a life of sin after professing faith in Christ, but you cannot change the truth as it is, either for yourself or for others. As such, it behooves you and your family to embrace truth, claim it for your own, and be genuinely set free for now and eternity. Come, and embrace this free gift of God, and live a victorious life for Him.</p><p>Charles Haddon (C. H.) Spurgeon (1834-1892) was a British Baptist preacher. He started preaching at age 19, and quickly became famous.

It&#x2019;s accompanied by the customary note written in block capital letters. By now, I know enough about politics&#x2014;and about my husband&#x2019;s family, I suppose&#x2014;to suspect this isn&#x2019;t a coincidence.</p><p>There&#x2019;s no return address (of course, there wouldn&#x2019;t be, would there?), but the envelope was postmarked yesterday in Boston, and the stamps are George Washington, five cents each. A plain manila envelope, letter size, of the sort they use in offices: I flip it back and forth between my fingers, while my heart bounds and rebounds against my ribs.</p><p>&#x201c;Tiny, my dear.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s my husband&#x2019;s grandmother, calling from the living room. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you going to watch the ceremony?&#x201d;</p><p>She has a remarkable way of forming a sociable question into a court summons, and like a court summons, she can&#x2019;t be ignored. I smooth my hand against the envelope once, twice, as if I can evaporate the contents&#x2014;<i>poof, presto!</i>&#x2014;in the stroke of a palm, and I slide it into one of the more obscure pigeonholes in the secretary, where the mail is laid every day by the housekeeper.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, of course,&#x201d; I call back.</p><p>The television has been bought new for the occasion. Generally, Granny Hardcastle frowns on modern devices; even my husband, Franklin, has to hide in the attic in order to listen to Red Sox games on the radio. The wireless, she calls it, a little disdainfully, though she&#x2019;s not necessarily averse to Sinatra or Glenn Miller in the evenings, while she sits in her favorite chintz chair in the living room and drinks her small glass of cognac. It drowns out the sound of the ocean, she says, which I can never quite comprehend. In the first place, you can&#x2019;t drown out the ocean when it flings itself persistently against your shore, wave after wave, only fifty yards past the shingled walls of your house, no matter how jazzy the trumpets backing up Mr. Sinatra.</p><p>In the second place, why would you want to?</p><p>I pause at the tray to pour myself a glass of lemonade. I add a splash of vodka, but only a tiny one. &#x201c;Have they started yet?&#x201d; I ask, trying to sound as cool as I look. The vodka, I&#x2019;ve found, is a reliable refrigerant.</p><p>&#x201c;No. They&#x2019;re trying to sell me Clorox.&#x201d; Granny Hardcastle stubs out her cigarette in the silver ashtray next to her chair&#x2014;she smokes habitually, but only in front of women&#x2014;and chews on her irony.</p><p>&#x201c;Lemonade?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, thank you. I&#x2019;ll have another cigarette, though.&#x201d;</p><p>I make my way to the sofa and open the drawer in the lamp table, where Mrs. Hardcastle keeps the cigarettes. Our little secret. I shake one out of the pack and tilt my body toward the television set, feigning interest in bleach, so that Franklin&#x2019;s grandmother won&#x2019;t see the wee shake of my fingers as I strike the lighter and hold it to the tip of the cigarette. These are the sorts of details she notices.</p><p>I hand her the lit cigarette.</p><p>&#x201c;Sit down,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re as restless as a cat.&#x201d;</p><p>There. Do you see what I mean? Just imagine spending the summer in the same house with her. You&#x2019;d be slipping the vodka into your lemonade in no time, trust me.</p><p>The French doors crash open from the terrace.</p><p>&#x201c;Has it started yet?&#x201d; asks one of the cousins&#x2014;Constance, probably&#x2014;before they all clatter in, brown limbed, robed in pinks and greens, smelling of ocean and coconuts.</p><p>&#x201c;Not yet. Lemonade?&#x201d;</p><p>I pour out four or five glasses of lemonade while the women arrange themselves about the room. Most of them arrived as I did, at the beginning of summer, members of the annual exodus of women and children from the Boston suburbs; some of them have flown in from elsewhere for the occasion. The men, with a few exceptions, are at work&#x2014;this is a Wednesday, after all&#x2014;and will join us tomorrow for a celebratory dinner to welcome home the family hero.</p><p>I pour a last glass of lemonade for Frank&#x2019;s four-year-old niece Nancy and settle myself into the last remaining slice of the sofa, ankles correctly crossed, skirt correctly smoothed. The cushions release an old and comforting scent. Between the lemonade and the ambient nicotine and the smell of the sofa, I find myself able to relax the muscles of my neck, and maybe one or two in my back as well. The television screen flickers silently across the room. The bottle of bleach disappears, replaced by Walter Cronkite&#x2019;s thick black eyeglass frames, and behind them, Mr. Cronkite himself, looking especially grave.</p><p>&#x201c;Tiny, dear, would you mind turning on the sound?&#x201d;</p><p>I rise obediently and cut a diagonal track across the rug to the television. It&#x2019;s not a large set, nor one of those grandly appointed ones you see in certain quarters. Like most of our caste, Mrs. Hardcastle invests lavishly in certain things, things that matter, things that last&#x2014;jewelry, shoes, houses, furniture, the education of the next generation of Hardcastles&#x2014;and not in others. Like television sets. And food. If you care to fasten your attention to the tray left out by the housekeeper, you&#x2019;ll spy an arrangement of Ritz crackers and pimiento spread, cubes of American cheese and small pale rubbery weenies from a jar. As I pass them by, on my return journey, I think of my honeymoon in the south of France, and I want to weep.</p><p>&#x201c;You should eat,&#x201d; Constance says, when I sit back down next to her. Constance is as fresh and rawboned as a young horse, and believes that every thin woman must necessarily be starving herself.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not hungry yet. Anyway, I had a large breakfast.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shh. Here they are,&#x201d; says Granny. Her armchair is right next to my place at the end of the sofa. So close I can smell her antique floral perfume and, beneath it, the scent of her powder, absorbing the joy from the air.</p><p>The picture&#x2019;s changed to the Rose Garden of the White House, where the president&#x2019;s face fills the screen like a grumpy newborn.</p><p>&#x201c;It looks hot,&#x201d; says Constance. A chorus of agreement follows her. People generally regard Constance&#x2019;s opinions as addenda to the Ten Commandments, around here. The queen bee, you might say, and in this family that&#x2019;s saying a lot. Atop her lap, a baby squirms inside a pink sundress, six months old and eager to try out the floor. &#x201c;Poor Frank, having to stand there like that,&#x201d; she adds, when it looks as if President Johnson means to prolong the anticipation for some time, droning on about the importance of the American presence in Vietnam and the perfidy of the Communists, while the Rose Garden blooms behind him.</p><p>A shadow drifts in from the terrace: Constance&#x2019;s husband, Tom, wearing his swim trunks, a white T-shirt, and an experimental new beard of three or four days&#x2019; growth. He leans his salty wet head against the open French door and observes us all, women and children and television. I scribble a note on the back of my brain, amid all the orderly lists of tasks, organized by category, to make sure the glass gets cleaned before bedtime.</p><p>Granny leans forward. &#x201c;You should have gone with him, Tiny. It looks much better when the wife&#x2019;s by his side. Especially a young and pretty wife like you. The cameras love a pretty wife. So do the reporters. You&#x2019;re made for television.&#x201d;</p><p>She speaks in her carrying old-lady voice, into a pool of studied silence, as everyone pretends not to have heard her. Except the children, of course, who carry on as usual. Kitty wanders up to my crossed legs and strokes one knee. &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;re pretty, too, Aunt Christina.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, thank you, honey.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Careful with your lemonade, kitten,&#x201d; says Constance.</p><p>I caress Kitty&#x2019;s soft hair and speak to Granny quietly. &#x201c;The doctor advised me not to, Mrs. Hardcastle.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My dear, it&#x2019;s been a week. I went to my niece&#x2019;s christening the next <i>day</i> after <i>my</i> miscarriage.&#x201d;</p><p>The word <i>miscarriage</i> pings around the room, bouncing off the heads of Frank&#x2019;s florid female cousins, off Kitty&#x2019;s glass of sloshing lemonade, off the round potbellies of the three or four toddlers wandering around the room, off the fat sausage toes of the two plump babies squirming on their mothers&#x2019; laps. Every one of them alive and healthy and lousy with siblings.</p><p>After a decent interval, and a long drag on her cigarette, Granny Hardcastle adds: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, dear. It&#x2019;ll take the next time, I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201d;</p><p>I straighten the hem of my dress. &#x201c;I think the president&#x2019;s almost finished.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;For which the nation is eternally grateful,&#x201d; says Constance.</p><p>The camera now widens to include the entire stage, the figures arrayed around the president, lit by a brilliant June sun. Constance is right; you can&#x2019;t ignore the heat, even on a grainy black-and-white television screen. The sweat shines from the white surfaces of their foreheads. I close my eyes and breathe in the wisps of smoke from Constance&#x2019;s nearby cigarette, and when I open them again to the television screen again, I search out the familiar shape of my husband&#x2019;s face, attentive to his president, attentive to the gravity of the ceremony.</p><p><i>A horse&#x2019;s ass,</i> Frank&#x2019;s always called Johnson in the privacy of our living room, but not one member of the coast-to-coast television audience would guess this opinion to look at my husband now. He&#x2019;s a handsome man, Franklin Hardcastle, and even more handsome in person, when the full Technicolor impact of his blue eyes hits you in the chest and that sleek wave of hair at his forehead commands the light from three dimensions. His elbows are crooked in perfect right angles. His hands clasp each other respectfully behind his back.</p><p>I think of the black-and-white photograph in its envelope, tucked away in the pigeonhole of the secretary. I think of the note that accompanied it, and my hand loses its grip, nearly releasing the lemonade onto the living room rug.</p><p>The horse&#x2019;s ass has now adjusted his glasses and reads from the citation on the podium before him. He pronounces the foreign geography in his smooth Texas drawl, without the slightest hesitation, as if he&#x2019;s spent the morning rehearsing with a Vietnamese dictionary.</p><p>&#x201c;. . . After carrying his wounded comrade to safety, under constant enemy fire, he then returned to operate the machine gun himself, providing cover for his men until the position at Plei Me was fully evacuated, without regard to the severity of his wounds.&#x201d;</p><p>Oh, yes. That. <i>The severity of his wounds</i>. I&#x2019;ve heard the phrase before, as the citation was read before us all in Granny Hardcastle&#x2019;s dining room in Brookline, cabled word for word at considerable expense from the capital of a grateful nation. I can also recite from memory an itemized list of the wounds in question, from the moment they were first reported to me, two days after they&#x2019;d been inflicted. They are scored, after all, on my brain.</p><p>None of that helps a bit, however. My limbs ache, actually <i>hurt</i> as I hear the words from President Johnson&#x2019;s lips. My ears ring, as if my faculties, in self-defense, are trying to protect me from hearing the litany once more. How is it possible I can feel someone else&#x2019;s pain like that? Right bang in the middle of my bones, where no amount of aspirin, no quantity of vodka, no draft of mentholated nicotine can touch it.</p><p>My husband listens to this recital without flinching. I focus on his image in that phalanx of dark suits and white foreheads. I admire his profile, his brave jaw. The patriotic crease at the corner of his eye.</p><p>&#x201c;He does look well, doesn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d; says Granny. &#x201c;Really, you&#x2019;d never know about the leg. Could you pass me the cigarettes?&#x201d;</p><p>One of the women reaches for the drawer and passes the cigarettes silently down the row of us on the sofa. I hand the pack and lighter to Granny Hardcastle, without looking. The camera switches back to a close-up of the president&#x2019;s face, the conclusion of the commendation.</p><p>You have to keep looking, I tell myself. You have to watch.</p><p>I close my eyes again. Which is worse somehow, because when your eyes are closed, you hear the sounds around you even more clearly than before. You hear them in the middle of your brain, as if they originated inside you.</p><p>&#x201c;This nation presents to you, Major Caspian Harrison, its highest honor and its grateful thanks for your bravery, your sacrifice, and your unflinching care for the welfare of your men and your country. At a time when heroes have become painfully scarce, your example inspires us all.&#x201d;</p><p>From across the room, Constance&#x2019;s husband makes a disgusted noise. The hinges squeak, and a gust of hot afternoon air catches my cheek as the door to the terrace widens and closes.</p><p>&#x201c;Why are you shutting your eyes, Tiny? Are you all right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just a little dizzy, that&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, come on. Get over it. You&#x2019;re going to miss him. The big moment.&#x201d;</p><p>I open my eyes, because I have to, and there stands President Lyndon Johnson, shaking hands with the award&#x2019;s recipient.</p><p>The award&#x2019;s recipient: my husband&#x2019;s cousin, Major Caspian Harrison of the Third Infantry Division of the U. S. Army, who now wears the Medal of Honor on his broad chest.</p><p>His face, unsmiling, which I haven&#x2019;t seen in two years, pops from the screen in such familiarity that I can&#x2019;t swallow, can hardly even breathe. I reach forward to place my lemonade on the sofa table, but in doing so I can&#x2019;t quite strip my gaze from the sandy-gray image of Caspian on the television screen and nearly miss my target.</p><p>Next to him, tall and monochrome, looking remarkably presidential, my husband beams proudly.</p><p><br>**</p><p><br>He calls me a few hours later from a hotel room in Boston. &#x201c;Did you see it?&#x201d; he asks eagerly.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course I did. You looked terrific.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Beautiful day. Cap handled himself fine, thank God.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s his leg?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Honey, the first thing you have to know about my cousin Cap, he doesn&#x2019;t complain.&#x201d; Frank laughs. &#x201c;No, he was all right. Hardly even limped. Modern medicine, it&#x2019;s amazing. I was proud of him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I could see that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s right here, if you want to congratulate him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No! No, please. I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;s exhausted. Just tell him . . . tell him congratulations. And we&#x2019;re all very proud, of course.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Cap!&#x201d; His voice lengthens. &#x201c;Tiny says congratulations, and they&#x2019;re all proud. They watched it from the Big House, I guess. Did Granny get that television after all?&#x201d; This comes through more clearly, directed at me.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, she did. Connie&#x2019;s husband helped her pick it out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, good. At least we have a television in the house now. We owe you one, Cap buddy.&#x201d;</p><p>A few muffled words find the receiver. Cap&#x2019;s voice.</p><p>Frank laughs again. &#x201c;You can bet on it. Besides the fact that you&#x2019;ve given my poll numbers a nice little boost today, flashing that ugly mug across the country like that.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Muffle muffle.</i> I try not to strain my ears. What&#x2019;s the point?</p><p>Whatever Caspian said, my husband finds it hilarious. &#x201c;You little bastard,&#x201d; he says, laughing, and then (still laughing): &#x201c;Sorry, darling. Just a little man-to-man going on here. Say, you&#x2019;ll never guess who&#x2019;s driving down with us tomorrow morning.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t imagine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your sister Pepper.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Pepper?</i>&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yep.

This book explores how, according to biblical prophecy, this same sorcery will return before the Second Coming of Jesus Christ to earth. These religious beliefs and practices will invade the end time church and become the basis for the religion of the Antichrist.

Yet for a small but growing group of savvy investors, they have become a tremendous asset. Written by one of the top professionals in the business, <strong><i>Mobile Home Wealth </i></strong>is an easy-to-understand book that can guide you to one of the most lucrative investments in real estate.</p> <p>The author begins by presenting the basic principles and practices of real estate investing. He then applies these principles to mobile homes, covering every step of the investment process from choosing a home to financing the purchase, negotiating the price, improving the property, and selling or renting for maximum gains. Whether you are looking for a smart addition to your portfolio or searching for a new and different business, this book will forever change the way you view mobile homes.</p></p><p><i> </i><p><i>Zalman Velvel </i>has been a fulltime real estate investor since 1981. His family owns and operates five mobile home parks, as well as warehouses, offices, duplexes, mini-warehouses, and motels. Zalman holds the coveted CCIM designation, as well as being licensed as a real estate broker, mortgage broker, auctioneer, mobile home dealer, and former real estate appraiser. Zalman is also licensed as a real estate trainer, and has trained more than 5,000 people in real estate investing. </p><p>If you are seeking financial independence, you are holding it in your hands. If you are tired of living paycheck-to-paycheck, read on. If you are worried that the company you work for may &#x201c;downsize&#x201d; you onto the unemployment line, or you&#x2019;re worried that your job may not even exist in the future, then you&#x2019;ve come to the right place for a better alternative in the real estate field.</p> <p>This book is written for people with little or no experience in real estate, or for those with a lifetime of experience but none with mobile homes. So if you never owned a piece of property, or if you are already a real estate investor and you want to add more strategies and another stream of income, you&#x2019;ve found the right book. Mobile homes are an overlooked part of the real estate market and are usually hidden from the average investor. This book will take you by the hand and show you how to make a good, secure living--or a fortune (your choice)--by using proven success formulas.</p> <p><strong>Formulas for Success</strong></p> <p>Throughout this book you will find simple formulas that we will call <em>formulas for success</em>. When you follow them, you are practically guaranteed positive results. Formulas are the foundation of almost every profession. The problem is, many successful people don&#x2019;t like to share their success formulas. Here, the formulas will be shared with you--and the good news is that they involve only simple math. The good news continues. These formulas can be applied to just about all forms of real estate. After you understand them, you can apply them to investing in single-family homes, duplexes, apartment buildings, warehouses, shopping centers, offices, retail stores, etc., as well as mobile homes.</p> <p><strong>Roadmap to $100,000 in Extra Money</strong></p> <p>You will receive, along with your formulas for success, a plan and a roadmap. After all, you don&#x2019;t just want to read and learn--you want to go out and <i>use</i> what you have learned to improve your life and those of your loved ones, don&#x2019;t you? You will be presented with a plan where you can earn an additional $100,000 per year, part-time, while you continue to work at your present career. Most people need to keep their current job while they create a new real estate investing career, so we are going to assume the same need for you. When you work the plan, and the plan works for you, and you feel secure, then you can decide whether you want to remain a part-time investor or quit your job and go full-time into affordable housing.</p> <p>You will receive many real-life examples to follow and train on. There will be no &#x201c;smoke and mirrors,&#x201d; or &#x201c;motivational rah rah&#x201d; where you are told repeatedly, &#x201c;If you think it, or imagine it, it will happen.&#x201d; Yes, it helps to have a positive attitude, and you will be encouraged to have one because it will energize you for the success you want. However, along with a good attitude you must have focused actions and a plan. Without effort on your part, all the motivation in the world isn&#x2019;t going to deliver the concrete results you want--more money in your pocket and more quality time for the important people in your life.</p> <p><strong>So What Exactly Is a Mobile Home?</strong></p> <p>Mobile homes are built in a factory and then transported and set in place for people to live in. The fancy term for them is <i>manufactured housing</i>. <i>The beautiful home pictured here is a mobile home--it was built in a factory in two sections, and then each section was towed down the highway and fit together on site. (The garage that you see was added later.)</i> However you refer to them, <i>they are the most affordable form of housing.</i> There is a huge demand for affordable housing, and there always will be. You are entering a field where you won&#x2019;t have to worry about the Internet or a computer eliminating your career. You also don&#x2019;t have to worry about a new single-family home or townhouse subdivision opening up down the street and under-selling you. They will not have more affordable housing than you.</p> <p>To understand just how affordable mobile homes are, think about this: Recently the median-priced home sold in the United States was worth $225,000. That means there were just as many homes sold above $225,000 as there were below that number. In simple terms, the number is similar to the average price. The median price for a new mobile home (without land) was around $50,000.&nbsp; That is less than a quarter of the price! If you are impressed by that number, then you should be even more impressed when I show you how to buy <i>good used mobile homes for $10,000 or less. </i>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>How Much Money Will You Need to Get Started?</strong></p> <p>Speaking of money, it would be nice if you could start out with some savings to invest, and good credit, but if you don&#x2019;t, you won&#x2019;t be left out. If you have no money to get started with and no credit, or even bad credit, don&#x2019;t worry. Several tried-and-true &#x201c;no money down&#x201d; strategies have also been included to get you started, each of which I have personally used, so you don&#x2019;t have to have any money or any credit to get started. That&#x2019;s totally different from buying a franchise like McDonald&#x2019;s or Burger King.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;Mobile Homes Are a Proven Franchise, but Without the Fees</strong></p> <p>Investing in mobile homes has all the positive elements of a franchise. There are millions of customers out there who need affordable housing as much as or more than they need a Big Mac or a Whopper. This book will give you proven management and marketing techniques to ensure your success in finding your customers, meeting their needs, and getting paid a healthy profit for doing so. However, unlike if you were running a franchise, you won&#x2019;t be paying huge upfront fees and no one will be siphoning off 10 percent or more of your income each month. Instead, you will be acquiring assets--land and buildings--that produce income, and you get to keep <i>all </i>of the profit. You also get to own the land and buildings, which appreciate in value--unlike tables and chairs and grills and fryers, which depreciate in value.</p> <p><strong>Let&#x2019;s Get to Know Each Other</strong></p> <p>Perhaps, at this point, you are wondering about this author&#x2019;s credibility? If you are, then good for you! Any time someone promises you important changes in your life, and wants money beforehand, you should ask about his qualifications. So let&#x2019;s get to know one another.</p> <p>I have been actively investing in real estate for more than twenty-five years, and in mobile homes in particular for more than fifteen years. I&#x2019;ve made millions doing it, and I&#x2019;m going to unlock the secrets so you can, too. I&#x2019;m also going to be upfront and honest about some of the pitfalls with a view to protecting you from making mistakes that might take some of the wind out of your sails.&nbsp;</p> <p>Another benefit to you is my more than ten years of experience working as a real estate trainer. Along the path of my investing career, I met the owner of one of the largest real estate seminar companies in the world, which was located in the same county where I live. We clicked immediately. As a result, I taught two courses for his company as an independent contractor. This book is based upon my years of experience teaching the curriculum of those two courses, which each cost $3,500 for three days of live training.</p> <p>I have trained literally thousands of people, from just about every walk of life and every age group, from all around our great country, to invest in real estate, so you can be sure the strategies and techniques you&#x2019;re going to receive actually work. Some strategies may work better than others in your area, so in that case you will just have to choose which are the most profitable and most interesting to you.</p> <p>I have also acquired a CCIM designation, which is billed as the PhD of commercial real estate. Along with that designation, I have a real estate brokerage license, a mortgage broker license, and an auctioneer&#x2019;s license. For many years, I also had a real estate appraisal license. My auctioneer&#x2019;s license will prove to be very useful to you because I sold hundreds of properties at auction, which put me in contact with thousands of investors. During negotiations I learned the strategies of the most successful investors. These strategies are also included in this book.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>OK. At this point, I have completed our introduction and we have gotten to know one another. I hope you&#x2019;re not thinking, <i>This Zalman is special, and I can never do what he does.<i></i> It would not be accurate to believe that. Instead, you should think, <i>If Zalman can do it, then so can I</i>.<i> Now, let&#x2019;s talk briefly about the three basic ways people like to learn, because this book is geared toward all three.</i></i></p> <p><strong>The Three Ways People Learn</strong></p> <p>The most common way people learn is by <i>watching an expert</i>do something, and then copying the expert, performing on their own and building confidence along the way. I have included lots of case histories with pictures to train you this way.</p> <p>The second most common way to learn is to watch the expert and then study lots of <i>facts and figures and manuals</i>. This is for people who need to believe<i> <i>they must know every possible thing about a subject, so that if anything ever goes wrong in the future, they will know how to fix it.<i></i> Please keep in mind that while it is a healthy goal to have as much information as possible before you start something new, many people who learn like this unfortunately develop &#x201c;paralysis of analysis,&#x201d; their minds so cluttered with facts that they lose sight of basic strategies. In other words, they wind up doing nothing because the goal of knowing everything that can possibly go wrong is not achievable. You will learn a different way of looking at problems here--that they are just another part of your investing process. You shouldn&#x2019;t be afraid of them--when unexpected problems happen . . . it&#x2019;s OK. When you learn how to overcome problems--and you will from this book--those problems will actually point the way to <i><i>more<i></i> strategies for making money. Then you will go out and try to find the same problems and create a good deal for yourself. You become a part of the solution and get paid handsomely for your effort!&nbsp;</i></i></i></i></p> <p>The last type of student is nothing short of thrilling. I refer to them as <i><i>Type 3s</i>.<i> Type 3s are people who just want a brief outline of what they need to do before jumping in and doing it. They learn while they are doing, and they don&#x2019;t want to be bogged down with facts and figures. In other words, they like combining learning and making money with adrenaline. They&#x2019;re the kind of people who like to jump into the deep end of the pool to learn how to swim. As a trainer, I enjoy these students, because I know they are going to use my training. But I also have to warn you that many times these students have entered my training carrying the mistakes they made before--when they jumped in without checking first to see if it was the right swimming pool for them to be in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></i></p> <p>This book is going to help all three kinds of learners. You&#x2019;re going to learn as I hold your hand and show you by example. Those of you who need to know as much as possible before getting involved are going to get formulas and facts but not so much data that you get bogged down and don&#x2019;t do anything at all. And for those who like the adrenaline rush, you are going to get roadmaps to follow so you don&#x2019;t jump into a pool that has no water in it and waste your time and energy trying to climb out.</p> <p><strong>Homework</strong></p> <p>You will get homework. What&#x2019;s that? I can almost hear you groaning from here, <i>Oh no, not homework!&#x201d;</i> Yes, homework. And you will be expected to do it because the homework you will be given here will make you real money. Plus, you&#x2019;ll be encouraged to have fun while you&#x2019;re doing it. Your grade will be what you add to your wallet and your balance sheet.<strong></strong></p> <p><strong>&nbsp;How the Book Is Set Up--A Logical Learning Process</strong></p> <p>There are five parts to this book, each of which builds on the previous one, filling in new skills that are vital yet simple. We will begin with a funny story called &#x201c;The Adventure,&#x201d; which describes the opportunity that led to my entry into the mobile home investment field.</p> <p>Then, in <i>Part One </i>of the book, you will be introduced to the Four Basic Profit Strategies<strong> </strong>and each strategy&#x2019;s <i><i>Formula for Success</i>.<i> You will learn how to think and act like a successful mobile home investor, determining your profit <i><i>before<i></i> you even own a property.</i></i></i></i></p> <p>In <i>Part Two,</i> you will learn how to <i>Get The Deal Right </i>using the Five Green Fs. You will be shown where to <i>find </i>your deals, how to <i>figure </i>out what they&#x2019;re worth, how <i>flag </i>the property with an offer that fully protects you and negotiate the best deal for yourself, how to inspect the property fully so you will know what you have to <i>fix</i>--and then, if the deal is a go, where to find the<i> financing </i>to buy it.</p> <p>In <i>Part Three,</i> you will learn how to <i>Reap Your Profits and Long-Term Wealth.</i> You will be shown how to close the deal, manage your mobile home ATM, and build a Power Team of professionals that will enable you to do it over and over again. You will be shown how to protect your assets and save on taxes. And you will also learn the <i>Three Secrets of Long-Term Wealth </i>so that you can provide for yourself and your loved ones for generations to come; this part is amusing but at the same time very powerful, and for many of you, it may be a whole new way of thinking.</p> <p>In the Conclusion, you will be given your roadmap.<strong> </strong>This is a<strong> </strong>plan whereby you can earn an additional $100,000 per year, part-time, while you continue to work at your present career. After you follow the plan, you can decide whether to remain a part-time mobile home investor or to go full-time. The choice is yours.</p> <p>I hope you are excited to begin, because I sure am.</p></p><h2>Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll: Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll</h2><p>Completely updated with new entries and extensive revisions of the previous 1,800, <i>The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia Of Rock &amp; Roll</i> is the authoritative volume on the world's music makers&#x2014;from the one-hit wonders to the megastars.<br><br>In 1983, Rolling Stone Press introduced its first <i>Rock &amp; Roll Encyclopedia.</i> Almost two decades later, it has become the premier guide to the history of rock &amp; roll, and has been selected by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame &amp; Museum as its official source of information. Giving full coverage to all aspects of the rock scene, it tells the story of rock &amp; roll in a clear and easy reference format, including complete discographies, personnel changes for every band, and backstage information like date and place of birth, from Elvis Presley to Eminem.<br> <br>Since the last edition, the music scene has exploded in every area, from boy-bands to hip-hop, electronica to indie rock. Here, the <i>Encyclopedia</i> explores them all&#x2014;'NSync, Notorious B.I.G., Ricky Martin, Radiohead, Britney Spears, Blink-182, Sean &#x201c;Puffy&#x201d; Combs, Portishead, Fatboy Slim, Fiona Apple, Lil' Kim, Limp Bizkit, Oasis, Outkast, Yo La Tengo, TLC, and many, many more. <i>The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll, Third Edition</i> includes all the facts, phenomena, and flukes that make up the history of rock. Accompanying the biographical and discographical information on the nearly 2,000 artists included in this edition are incisive essays that reveal the performers' musical influences, first breaks, and critical and commercial hits and misses, as well as evaluations of their place in rock history. Filled with hundreds of historical photos, <i>The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia</i> is more than just a reference book, it is the bible of rock &amp; roll.</p><p>This latest incarnation of an authoritative encyclopedia first published in 1983 boasts over 100 new entries and many revisions to the 1800 entries found in the 1995 edition. The coverage increase was made possible by the omission of three kinds of "nonartist" entries: the Grammy Award boxes, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame boxes, and the style and genre definitions. As with the previous editions, the scope is excellent: few works can compete in terms of blanket coverage of the major rock'n'roll players, which dates from the 1950s to the present and includes names as diverse as Elvis, Chad and Jeremy, Britney, and Eminem. The alphabetically arranged entries contain birth and, when applicable, death dates; a discography; and an essay that attempts (usually successfully) to put the performer's or group's work in critical and historical perspective. The introduction by coeditor Romanowski cogently sums up the criteria and methodology, and though her reasons for featuring or deleting artists are subjective, they are hard to counter. This latest edition even offers an index of acts cut from the second edition. Useful, reasonably priced, and including well-written essays by respected music writers, this is highly recommended for any public or academic library. David M. Turkalo, Suffolk Univ. Law Sch.

OPEN AND SHUT is his first novel.Just as Joe Mantegna IS Spenser, and Judy Kaye IS Kinsey Millhone, Grover Gardner, with his deadpan reserve, IS Andy Carpenter, the self-deprecating mystery-solving, dog-loving millionaire defense attorney. This time around there's plenty of craziness as Carpenter attempts to clear a pro football player of murder, all the while being followed by a screenwriter who wants to make a true-story movie of the events (if only he could give an "arc" to Carpenter's life). This is Rosenfelt's fourth Andy Carpenter mystery and the second to make it to audiobook, so it's time to make a plea: Whoever is in charge . . . let Gardner read the other two, pronto.

He gingerly extracted a fat pair of angry crustaceans from the trap, pegged the claws and tossed the lobsters into a holding tank, then he rebaited the trap with a fish head, pushed the wire cage over the side and went into the pilothouse for his binoculars. He peered through the lenses and silently mouthed the word "Wow!"</p><p>The ship was huge. Jenkins examined the vessel from stem to stern with an expert eye. Before retiring to take up lobster-fishing, he had taught oceanography for years at the University of Maine, and he had spent many summer breaks on survey ships-but this vessel was like nothing he had ever seen. He estimated its length at about six hundred feet. Derricks and cranes sprouted from its deck. Jenkins guessed it was some sort of ocean mining or exploration vessel. He watched until the ship vanished from sight, then went back to pull the rest of the string of pots.</p><p>Jenkins was a tall, rangy man in his sixties, whose rugged features mirrored the rockbound coast of his native Maine. A smile crossed his deeply tanned face as he hauled in the last trap. It had been an exceptionally good day. He had found the honey hole by accident a couple of months earlier. The spot produced an endless supply of lobsters, and he kept coming back even though he had to go farther from land than normal. Fortunately, his thirty-six-foot wooden boat was seaworthy even with a full load. Setting a course for land, he put the boat on autopilot and went below to reward himself with what they used to call a Dagwood sandwich when he was a kid. He had just layered in another slice of baloney on top of the pile of ham, cheese and salami when he heard a muffled "Boom!" It sounded like a thunderclap, but it seemed to come from below.</p><p>The boat shuddered so violently the jars of mustard and mayonnaise rolled off the counter. Jenkins tossed his knife in the sink and sprang up to the deck. He wondered if the propeller had broken off or if he had hit a floating log, but nothing seemed amiss. The sea was calm and almost flat. Earlier, the blue surface had reminded him of a Rothko canvas.</p><p>The boat had stopped vibrating, and he took a wondering look around, then, shrugging, went below. He finished making his sandwich, cleaned up and went out on the deck to eat. Noticing a couple of lobster traps that had shifted, he secured them with a line, then as he stepped back into the wheelhouse, he experienced a sudden unpleasant stomach-sinking sensation, as if someone had pushed the Up button in a fast elevator. He grabbed onto the mechanical hauler to keep his footing. The boat plunged, then levitated again, higher this time, plummeted once more and repeated the cycle a third time before sinking back into the sea, where it rocked violently from side to side.</p><p>After a few minutes, the motion stopped and the boat stabilized, and Jenkins saw a flickering movement in the distance. Retrieving his binoculars from the wheelhouse, he swept the sea, and as he adjusted the focus ring, he saw three dark furrows extending from north to south. The ranks of waves were moving in the direction of the coast. A long-dormant alarm bell clanged in his head. It can't be. His mind raced back to that July day in 1998 off the coast of Papua New Guinea. He had been on a ship, making a survey, when there had been a mysterious explosion and the seismic instruments had gone crazy, indicating a disturbance on the seafloor. Recognizing the symptoms of a tsunami, the scientists aboard the ship had tried to warn the coast, but many of the villages had no communication. The huge waves had flattened the villages like a giant steamroller. The destruction was horrifying. Jenkins never forgot the sight of bodies impaled on mangrove branches, of crocodiles preying on the dead.</p><p>The radio crackled with a chorus of hard-edged Maine accents as fishermen set the airways abuzz. "Whoa!" said a voice Jenkins recognized as that of his neighbor, Elwood Smalley. "Hear that big boomer?"</p><p>"Sounded like a jet fighter, only underwater," another fisherman said.</p><p>"Anyone else feel those big seas?" said a third man.</p><p>"Yup," replied a laconic veteran lobsterman named Homer Gudgeon. "Thought for a time there I was on a roller coaster!"</p><p>Jenkins barely heard the other voices chiming in. He dug a pocket calculator out of a drawer, estimated the time between the waves and their height, did some quick calculations and glanced with disbelief at the numbers. Then he picked up the cell phone he used when he didn't want personal messages to go over the marine channel and punched out a number.</p><p>The gravelly voice of Charlie Howes, Rocky Cove's police chief, came on the phone.</p><p>"Charlie, thank God I got you!"</p><p>"In my cruiser on my way to the station, Roy. You calling to crow about whippin' me at chess last night?"</p><p>"Another time," Jenkins said. "I'm east of Rocky Point. Look, Charlie, we don't have much time. There's a big wave heading right toward town."</p><p>He heard a dry chuckle at the other end. "Hell, Roy," the chief said, "town like ours on the water is bound to get lots of waves."</p><p>"Not like this one. You've got to evacuate the people from near the harbor, especially the new motel."</p><p>Jenkins thought the phone had gone dead. Then came Charlie Howe's famous guffaw. "I didn't know today was April Fool's."</p><p>"Charlie, this is no joke," Jenkins said in exasperation. "That wave is going to slam into the harbor. I don't know how strong it will be, because there are lots of unknowns, but that motel is right in its path."</p><p>The chief laughed again. "Hell, some people would be real happy to see the Harbor View washed into the sea."</p><p>The two-story edifice that extended into the harbor on stilts had been a source of controversy for months. It had gone up only after a bitter fight, an expensive lawsuit filed by the developers and what many suspected were bribes to officials.</p><p>"They're going to get their wish, but you've got to get the guests out first."</p><p>"Hell, Roy, there must be a hundred people staying there. I can't roust them out for no reason. I'll lose my job. Even worse, I'll be a laughingstock."</p><p>Jenkins checked his watch and cursed under his breath. He hadn't wanted to panic the chief, but he had reached the end of his self-control.</p><p>"Goddamnit, you old fool! How will you feel if a hundred people die because you're afraid of being laughed at?"</p><p>"You're not kidding, are you, Roy?"</p><p>"You know what I did before I took up lobstering."</p><p>"Yeah, you were a professor at the university up at Orono."</p><p>"That's right. I headed up the Oceanography Department. We studied wave action. You've heard of the Perfect Storm? You've got the perfect tidal wave heading your way. I calculate it will hit in twenty-five minutes. I don't care what you tell those motel people. Tell them there's a gas leak, a bomb threat, anything. Just get them out and to higher ground. And do it now."</p><p>"Okay, Roy. Okay."</p><p>"Is there anything open on Main Street?"</p><p>"Coffee shop. Jacoby kid is on the night shift. I'll have him swing by, then check out the fish pier."</p><p>"Make sure everybody is out of the area in fifteen minutes. That goes for you and Ed Jacoby."</p><p>"Will do. Thanks, Roy. I think. 'Bye."</p><p>Jenkins was almost dizzy with tension. He pictured Rocky Point in his mind. The town of twelve hundred was built like the seats in an amphitheater, its houses clustered on the side of a small hill overlooking the roughly circular harbor. The harbor was relatively sheltered, but the town's inhabitants had learned after a couple of hurricane-driven storm surges to build back from the water. The old brick maritime buildings on the main street bordering the harbor had been given over to shops and restaurants that served tourists. The fish pier and the motel dominated the harbor. Jenkins cranked up the throttle and prayed that his warning had arrived in time.</p><p><br>CHIEF Howes immediately regretted agreeing to Roy's urgent pleas, and was overcome by a numbing sense of uncertainty. Damned if he did, damned if he didn't. He'd known Jenkins since they were kids and Roy was the smartest one in class. He had never known him to fail as a friend. Still. Oh hell, he was near retirement anyhow.</p><p>Howes switched on his flasher, nailed the accelerator and, with a smoky screech of tires, roared toward the waterfront. While he drove the short distance, he got the deputy on the radio and told him to clear out the coffee shop then to go along Main Street with his PA system blasting, warning people to get to high ground. The chief knew the diurnal rhythms of his town: who would be up, who would be walking a dog. Luckily, most businesses didn't open before ten.</p><p>The motel was another story. Howes pulled over two empty buses on their way to pick up schoolchildren and told the drivers to follow him. The cruiser squealed to a stop beneath the motel's canopy, and the chief huffed his way to the front door. Howes had been on the fence about the motel. It would spoil the integrity of the harbor, but it might bring in jobs for locals; not everyone in town wanted to be a fisherman. On the other hand, he didn't like the way the project was rammed through to approval. He couldn't prove it, but he was sure there had been bribes at town hall.</p><p>The developer was a local named Jack Shrager, an unprincipled land raper who was building condos along the river that ran off the harbor, further despoiling the town's quiet beauty. Shrager never did hire locals, preferring foreigners who worked long and cheap.</p><p>The desk clerk, a young Jamaican, looked up with a startled expression on his thin, dark face as the chief burst into the lobby and shouted: "Get everyone out of the motel! This is an emergency!"</p><p>"What's the problem, mon?"</p><p>"I've been told there's a bomb here."</p><p>The desk clerk gulped. Then he got on the switchboard and began to call rooms.</p><p>"You've got ten minutes," Howes emphasized. "There are buses waiting in front. Get everyone out, including yourself. Tell anyone who refuses that the police will arrest them."</p><p>The chief strode down the nearest hallway and pounded on doors. "Police! You must evacuate this building immediately. You have ten minutes," he yelled at the sleepy faces that peered out. "There has been a bomb threat. Don't stop to gather your belongings."</p><p>He repeated the message until he was hoarse. The hallways filled with people in bathrobes and pajamas or with blankets wrapped around them. A swarthy man with an unpleasant scowl on his face stepped from one room. "What the hell is going on?" Jack Shrager demanded.</p><p>Howes swallowed hard. "There's been a bomb threat, Jack. You've got to get out."</p><p>A young blond woman poked her head out of the room. "What's wrong, babe?"</p><p>"There's a bomb in the motel," the chief said, becoming more specific.</p><p>The woman's face went pale and she stepped into the hallway. She was still in her silk bathrobe. Shrager tried to hold her, but she pulled away.</p><p>"I'm not staying here," she said.</p><p>"And I'm not moving," Shrager said. He slammed the door.</p><p>Howes shook his head in frustration, then guided the woman by the arm, joining the throng heading for the front door. He saw the buses were almost filled and yelled at the drivers.</p><p>"Get out of here in five minutes. Drive to the highest hill in town."</p><p>He slid behind the wheel of his cruiser and drove to the fish pier. The deputy was arguing with three fishermen. Howes saw what was happening and yelled out the window, "Get your asses into those trucks and go to the top of Hill Street or you'll be arrested."</p><p>"What the hell is going on, Charlie?"</p><p>Howes lowered his voice. "Look, Buck, you know me. Just do as I say and I'll explain later."</p><p>The fisherman nodded, then he and the others got into their pickups. Howes told his deputy to follow them and made one last sweep along the fish pier, where he picked up an elderly man who sorted through the rubbish bins for cans and bottles. Then he scoured Main Street, saw that it was quiet and headed for the top of Hill Street.</p><p>Some of the people who stood shivering in the cool air of morning shouted at him. Howes ignored their insults, got out of his cruiser and walked partway down the steep hill that led down toward the harbor. Now that the adrenaline rush was over, he felt weak-kneed. Nothing. He checked his watch. Five minutes came and went. And so did his dreams of a peaceful retirement on a police pension. I'm dead, he thought, sweating despite the coolness.</p><p>Then he saw the sea rise above the horizon and heard what sounded like distant thunder. The townspeople stopped shouting. A darkness loomed out near the channel entrance and the harbor emptied out-he could actually see bottom-but the phenomenon lasted only a few seconds. The water roared back in with a noise like a 747 taking off, and the sea lifted the moored fishing boats as if they were toys. It was reinforced by two more waves, seconds apart, each taller than the one before. They surged over the shore. When they receded, the motel and the fish pier had vanished.</p><p><br>THE Rocky Point that Jenkins returned to was far different from the one he had left that morning. The boats moored in the harbor were jumbled together along the shore in a tangled heap of wood and fiberglass. Smaller craft had been thrown up onto Main Street. Shop windows were smashed as if by a gang of vandals. The water was littered with debris and seaweed, and a sulfuric smell of sea bottom mixed with the odor of dead fish. The motel had vanished. Only pilings remained of the fish pier, although the sturdy concrete bulkhead showed no sign of damage. Jenkins pointed his boat toward a figure waving his arms on the bulkhead. Chief Howes grabbed the mooring lines and tied them off, then he stepped aboard.</p><p>"Anybody hurt?" Jenkins said, his eyes sweeping the harbor and town.</p><p>"Jack Shrager was killed. He's the only one as far as we know. We got everyone else out of the motel."</p><p>"Thanks for believing me. Sorry I called you an old fool."</p><p>The chief puffed his cheeks out. "That's what I would have been if I'd sat on my ass and done nothing."</p><p>"Tell me what you saw," Jenkins said, the scientist reasserting itself over the Samaritan.</p><p>Howes laid out the details. "We were standing at the top of Hill Street. Sounded and looked like a thunderstorm, then the harbor emptied out like a kid pulling the plug in a bathtub. I could actually see bottom. That only lasted a few seconds before the water roared in like a jet plane."</p><p>"That's an apt comparison. On the open ocean, a tsunami can go six hundred miles an hour."</p><p>"That's fast!" the chief said.</p><p>"Luckily, it slows down as it approaches land and hits shallower water. But the wave energy doesn't diminish with the speed."</p><p>"It wasn't like I pictured. You know, a wall of water fifty feet high. This was more like a wave surge. I counted three of them, each bigger than the last. Thirty feet, maybe. They whacked the motel and pier and flooded Main Street." He shrugged. "I know you'...</p></p><h2>Janitors, Book 2: Secrets of New Forest Academy</h2><p>Tyler Whitesides Now available in paperback!

Through a series of richly detailed anecdotes, Johnson emerges as a sociable figure, vigorously engaging and fencing with great contemporaries such as Garrick, Goldsmith, Burney and Burke, and of course with Boswell himself. Yet anxieties and obsessions also darkened Johnson's private hours, and Boswell's attentiveness to every facet of Johnson's character makes this biography as moving as it is entertaining. <br><br> In this entirely new and unabridged edition, David Womersley's introduction examines the motives behind Boswell's work, and the differences between the two men that drew them to each other. It also contains chronologies of Boswell and Johnson, appendices and comprehensive indexes, including biographical details.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.</p><p><b>James Boswell</b> (1740-1795) was a lawyer, diarist, and author born in Edinburgh. He is best known as the biographer of Samuel Johnson. Boswell is known for taking voracious notes on the grand tour of Europe that he took as a young nobleman and, subsequently, of his tour to Scotland with Johnson. He also recorded meetings and conversations with eminent individuals belonging to 'The Club', including David Garrick, Edmund Burke, Joshua Reynolds and Oliver Goldsmith. Samuel Johnson was born in Lichfield in 1709 and was educated at Lichfield Grammar School and, for a short time, at Pembroke College, Oxford. In 1735 he married Elizabeth Jervis Porter and in 1737 moved to London. There, he became a regular contributor to the Gentleman's Magazine, but struggled to earn a living from writing. His London: A Poem in Imitation of the Third Satire of Juvenal was published anonymously in 1738 and attracted some attention. From 1750 to 1752 he issued the Rambler, a periodical written almost entirely by himself, and consolidated his position as a notable moral essayist with some twenty-five essays in the Adventurer. When his Dictionary of the English Language was published in 1755, Johnson took on the proportions of a literary monarch in the London of his day. In need of money to visit his sick mother, he wrote Rasselas (1759) reportedly in the evenings of one week, finishing a couple of days after his mother's death. In 1763 Boswell became his faithful follower and it is mainly due to him that we owe our intimate knowledge of Johnson. Johnson's last major work was Lives of the Poets. He died in December 1784. <br><br><b> David Womersley</b> is the Thomas Warton Professor of English Literature at the University of Oxford. He has published widely on English literature from the Renaissance to the early nineteenth century. For Penguin he has edited Gibbon's History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Augustan Critical Writing, Burke's Philosophical Enquiry into the Sublime and Beautiful and Other Pre-Revolutionary Writings, and Samuel Johnson's Selected Essays.`Boswell&#39;s life must be the greatest biography ever written; crammed with sage advice and anecdotes both comical and touching, it is best taken unabridged.&#39; The Week</p><h2>THE POWER OF UNLIMITED IMAGINATION: A Collection of Neville&#39;s San Francisco Lectures</h2><p><b>For over 70 years, DeVorss Publications has been the proud publisher of Neville Goddard, who was among the last century's most articulate and charismatic purveyors of the New Thought philosophy.</b> <p><b><i>There is only one cause for the phenomena of life. Only by observing your own consciousness can you discover the cause of what is happening to you.</i></b></p><br>These are the words of Neville in the opening chapter of <b>THE POWER OF UNLIMITED IMAGINATION.</b> But observing your consciousness is merely the beginning. Understanding the role imagination plays in directing your consciousness is where the life-changing power resides. Imagination was at the core of the message Neville taught for so many years. THE POWER OF UNLIMITED IMAGINATION is a collection of some of his most eloquent lectures and speaking engagements from San Francisco in 1952.<br><br><b>TOPICS INCLUDE:</b> Your Infinite Worth, Desire, Seeing God, the Perfect Will of God, The Pearl of Great Price, Self-Remembering, Your Destiny, Your Personal Autobiography, The Human Spirit, Awake, O Sleeper, and others.</p><p>Born in Barbados, West Indies, Neville came to the United States to study drama at the age of seventeen. In 1932 he gave up the theater to devote his attention to his studies in mysticism when he began his lecture career in New York City. After traveling throughout the country, he eventually made his home in Los Angeles where, in the late 1950 s, he gave a series of talks on television, and for many years, lectured regularly to capacity audiences at the Wilshire Ebell Theater. Although Neville s career peaked in the late 1950 s and early 60 s, his message continues to find a place in the hearts of spiritual readers throughout the world today. Neville Goddard was one of the more quietly dramatic and supremely influential teachers in the New Thought field for many years.A popular speaker on metaphysical themes from the late 1930s until his death in 1972, Neville authored ten books in which he captured the sheer logic of creative mind principles. His work has impacted me in a very profound way; in fact, he s been a great mentor to me in the past few years. ~DR. WAYNE DYER, author of Wishes Fulfilled<br>The words of spiritual teacher Neville Goddard retain their power to electrify . . . he captured the sheer logic of creative-mind principles as perhaps no other figure of his era. --Science of Mind Magazine</p><h2>The Enemy: (Jack Reacher 8)</h2><p><b>'There's only one Jack Reacher.

She is currently a senior-level doula in Boston as well as a maternity massage specialist. <br><br>Rachel Zimmerman is an award-winning reporter who covers health and medicine for the Wall Street Journal. She lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<i>Chapter One<br>Doulas Are Great Pain Relief</i><br><br>I did not end up taking pain medicine in labor, but I almost feel like I did. Instead, my partner and my doula took turns massaging me for my whole labor, which lasted three days. While I was pregnant, our doula taught us some easy ways to use touch, and she said our homework was to practice cuddling, which was fine with us!<br><br>By the time labor came, my partner and I knew how to keep touching naturally, and it turned out to be a great relief for the pain. My labor was a lot of work, but our doula was there every moment, and the nurturing from her and my partner really was like a wonderful drug in itself.<br><br>&#x2014;Sylvia, 29, real-estate agent, mother of two<br><br>G iving birth with a doula is the most important trend of modern maternity care. The word comes from the Greek, translated to mean &#x201c;slave&#x201d; or &#x201c;servant.&#x201d; It was first used in the 1970s by the anthropologist Dana Raphael, who adopted it to mean a helper of new mothers. (Though some Greeks and doulas are not crazy about the word, it has become commonplace.)<br><br>Doulas are today&#x2019;s new experts in labor. Trained as professional birth companions, they act as highly skilled guides through the dramatic forces of labor. Using a combination of wit, science, and the ancient (but nearly lost) art of human support in birth, doulas have a powerful effect on the first major rite of passage we all must complete: being born.<br><br>And we like to think of it this way too: doulas can be your best form of pain relief in birth.<br><br>Their philosophy is to stay with you constantly, from start to finish in active labor, without taking breaks or changing shifts (which is not possible for most doctors, nurses, or midwives in hospitals). They come equipped with the ability to remain calm as the waves of labor intensify, to provide solid guidance for new dads and loved ones, to advocate for you with skill, and to remember all of the available labor techniques, with clear insight about when it&#x2019;s wise to use each one.<br><br>Birth doulas, also known as labor assistants, may guide you in: breathing methods or relaxation images, intensive emotional coaching, feedback on whether your labor pain is within normal range, and ways to actually sleep during the marathon work of labor. They may offer techniques to prevent the extra pain of back labor; delivery positions that use gravity in your favor; and even advanced specialties, such as hypnotherapy for pain relief, professional massage therapy, or acupuncture.<br><br>Doulas can help first-time parents give birth with less fear, help experienced mothers find new strength, and help women giving birth after a cesarean have more options.<br><br>In 2002 and 2006, the respected organization Childbirth Connection issued two groundbreaking reports, Listening to Mothers I and II, the first-ever surveys of women&#x2019;s own experiences giving birth across the United States. And when it came to labor support, mothers rated a doula&#x2019;s help more effective than that of any other health-care provider.<br><br>In most cases, a doula works independently&#x2014;directly for you&#x2014;which allows her to openly serve as your advocate. Also, doulas are often the only maternity-care providers who have worked at every hospital in town. This gives them a rare bird&#x2019;s-eye view of important birthing trends, advances, and setbacks in your community.<br><br>Doulas have something new to say about birth. Amid climbing cesarean rates and other national and worldwide debates in maternal health care, the doula movement has been taking hold as a way for pregnant women to regain more control over their birthing process.<br><br>If you&#x2019;ve already decided to use a doula, this book will help you make the most of what she has to offer. If you are new to this revolutionary trend, we&#x2019;ll be providing information that will help you decide whether to work with a doula. And even if you are not able to work with one, you will benefit from the doula wisdom that can help you have a more empowered birth.<br><br>In writing this book, we stand on the shoulders of other authors who first introduced the world to the idea of doulas, including Dr. John Kennell, Dr. Marshall Klaus, and Phyllis Klaus, CSW, the pioneering researchers who have studied and written about the benefits of doulas for the past three decades. The Klauses and Dr. Kennell collected much of the data on doulas that is accepted in the field now. Multiple studies show that the presence of a labor assistant can cut your chances in half for encountering many problems and interventions in birth. Most impressive, this includes the need for such common but major medical procedures as epidurals and cesareans.<br><br>Our goal is to build on this work and share with the public the actual techniques, skills, and trade secrets that allow doulas to achieve such remarkable results. As doulas shape their emerging profession, they are contributing original ideas to central issues such as how long labor should take, the most effective ways to prepare for normal and unusual levels of pain in labor, and much more.<br><br>The Doula Guide to Birth is a book for all pregnant women&#x2014;single, married, partnered, heterosexual, lesbian, and mothers whose baby will be adopted by another family. Doulas benefit all types of families by honoring their choices, relieving them of the pressure of having to be labor experts, and allowing them to give birth with the security of a familiar guide. Also, partners, fathers, and loved ones are invited to read all sections of this book, and chapter 2 speaks directly to them.<br><br>While the authors of this book live in the United States, where the modern doula movement was born, the doula trend has become an international phenomenon. That is why you will see references to birthing customs in various countries, meant to address our readers globally, and to remind us all of our connection to mothers around the world.<br><br>Support Is What Gets Women Through Labor<br><br>For ages, mothers gave birth surrounded by women who knew them well, whether it was a couple of local wise women or a crowd of female relatives and neighbors. When birth was moved into hospitals in the last century, this took a heavy toll on women&#x2019;s ability to rely on a personal support system in labor. Medical doctors did not realize that isolating women made birth more difficult and painful.<br><br>Birth is normally the most profound event of our lives. Like running a marathon yet even more intense, it is easier to accomplish with the steady faith of admirers and friends, and the know-how of those who have been there before. While modern maternity care often leaves mothers and fathers alone in labor, doulas focus their attention on you every moment of the way. This kind of social support provides a sense of security that may be the most important factor for getting through birth.<br><br>The doula approach is usually not to leave your delivery room unless it&#x2019;s requested, or she needs a bathroom break or a meal. At those moments, she gives her reassurances that she will quickly return. Mothers in labor are often keenly aware of when their supporters are missing from the room. Depending on the style of a particular doula, as well as your own needs and preferences, a doula may offer support by being a calm and quiet presence during many hours of labor, or she might gently coach and talk you through nearly every contraction.<br><br>Human support relieves pain, reduces fear of the unknown, and makes labor manageable in a way that isn&#x2019;t possible when that support is removed. In fact, throughout most of history, human support was entirely what women relied on to ease the way through childbearing (pain drugs simply were not available). And the tradition of women helping women benefited more than the laboring mother. It also benefited her supporters; other women learned what to expect when they would give birth, and they also gained confidence in their ability to help someone through labor&#x2014;an important achievement in itself.<br><br>In recent decades, ordinary women saw the need for doulas and began answering the call. They looked to trailblazers like Rahima Baldwin Dancy of Informed Homebirth/Informed Birth &amp; Parenting (later to become ALACE), Paulina Perez, and Penny Simkin of Doulas of North America (later to become DONA International), who were among the first to begin teaching women how to support laboring mothers. Doulas are usually trained by attending an intensive seminar over several days and then studying textbooks on birth. Ultimately though, a doula&#x2019;s knowledge comes from an experience most doctors and nurses never get to have&#x2014;staying with women nonstop through their entire labors. The rise of doulas is a powerful example of women taking grassroots action to help themselves and other women.<br><i><br>Doulas: The Best Medicine</i><br><br>Although doulas are not trained in medical schools, they have an important effect on birth, medically.<br><br>Some women seek a labor assistant to help them achieve a goal of natural childbirth. However, even if that is not a mother&#x2019;s main goal, a doula has the effect of reducing the likelihood of medical interventions, along with their possible risks.<br><br>According to the Cochrane Collaboration, the respected organization that reviews international clinical research, studies of more than one thousand mothers show that the presence of a doula results in lower rates of all types of pain medicine, cesareans, and deliveries with forceps or vacuums. Smaller studies show that rates of other procedures are reduced with a doula, including breaking the bag of waters artificially and the use of drugs to speed labor. (These were controlled studies comparing groups of women who were otherwise similar.)<br><br>In countries including the United States and Canada, the most common form of pain relief in birth has become the epidural, a type of anesthesia that numbs the body from the waist down. But increasingly, women are learning they can also have the support of a doula, instead of or in addition to medication, and they&#x2019;re reporting more positive birth experiences&#x2014;including less pain. All women wonder how they will manage labor pain; a doula helps settle their fears. And while anesthesia and surgery have become common in labor, medical procedures for birth (like those for any health condition) have potential side effects.<br><br>The Listening to Mothers surveys showed that after giving birth, the majority of women nationally said they had not understood the risks of the medical interventions they received in labor. As numerous doulas have observed, when doctors discuss consent for an epidural with pregnant women, they do not always fully explain one of its most important side effects: epidurals lower the blood pressure of one in three mothers, and therefore lower blood flow and oxygen to the baby. This can create changes in the baby&#x2019;s heart rate which may be seen as &#x201c;fetal distress,&#x201d; a cause of further interventions and cesareans.</p><h2>Leader of the Pack: An Andy Carpenter Mystery (An Andy Carpenter Novel, 10)</h2><p><p>Over the course of his legal career, Andy Carpenter has lost a few cases. But that doesn't mean he forgets his clients. Andy has always been convinced that Joey Desimone, a man convicted of murder nine years ago, was innocent and believes that Joey's family's connections to organized crime played a pivotal role in his conviction. While there isn't much Andy can do for him while he serves out his prison sentence, Joey suggests that he check up on Joey's elderly uncle. He'd rather not, but as a favor to Joey, Andy agrees to take his dog, Tara, on a few visits.</p><p>The old man's memory is going, but when Andy tries to explain why he's there, it jogs something in the man's mind, and his comments leave Andy wondering if Uncle Nick is confused, or if he just might hold the key to Joey's freedom after all this time. Andy grabs on to this thread of possibility and follows it into a world where the oath of silence is stronger than blood ties, and where people will do anything to make sure their secrets are kept.</p><p>Riveting, suspenseful, and highly entertaining, <i>Leader of the Pack</i> is bestseller David Rosenfelt's latest entry in his much-beloved Andy Carpenter series.</p></p><p><p>DAVID ROSENFELT is the Edgar and Shamus Award-nominated author of five stand-alones, most recently <i>Airtight</i>, and ten previous Andy Carpenter novels, most recently <i>One Dog Night</i>. After years living in California, he and his wife moved to Maine with twenty-five dogs that they've rescued. Rosenfelt's hilarious account of this cross-country move, <i>Dogtripping</i>, is being published by St. Martin's Press in July 2013.</p>By the time Peyton Manning threw the pass, Richard Solarno was dead. <br> <br>When Richard got up to answer the doorbell, Manning was directing the Colts in the no-huddle offense. Consistent with his style of play, Manning surveyed the defense while at the line of scrimmage, calling audibles based on what he saw before him. <br> <br>As was often the case, Manning could do this for at least twenty-five or thirty seconds, until the play clock was about to run out. <br> <br>Since Solarno had bet a lot of money on the Colts, and they were down by four on the Patriots&#x2019; eighteen-yard line with thirty seconds to play, he wasn&#x2019;t happy about leaving the television at all. Chances are it was just a deliveryman, and he could deal with it and be back without missing a play. At least that&#x2019;s what he hoped. <br> <br>That&#x2019;s not how it worked out. He opened the door, and managed to get out the words &#x201c;what are you&#x201d; before the bullet hit him in the chest, sending him falling backward. <br> <br>There was a silencer on the gun, so the killer knew that no neighbors were calling 911. Solarno was technically still alive when he hit the floor, but likely dead by the time Manning threw the interception, effectively costing the Colts the game. But that was no longer Solarno&#x2019;s problem; he wouldn&#x2019;t be paying bookmakers ever again. <br> <br>The killer heard a noise from the top of the stairs, so he entered the house, closing the door behind him. He then headed straight up the stairs, and within three minutes ended the life of Richard&#x2019;s wife, Karen, as well. <br> <br>That had not been part of the plan, but it had to be done. <br> <br>&#x201c;So, what&#x2019;s on tap for today?&#x201d; <br> <br>Laurie&#x2019;s question, while seemingly innocuous, represents something of a problem, because my &#x201c;tap&#x201d; for today is not something she is likely to approve of. <br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m going to take Tara for a walk. Then I&#x2019;m going to run over to the market for some beer, be back here by noon for the NFL pregame shows. I&#x2019;ll call my bookie, Jimmy Rollins, at twelve thirty to bet the games; then I&#x2019;ll order a pizza. At one I&#x2019;ll watch the Giants-Redskins game, switching to other games during time-outs. <br> <br>&#x201c;Then, at four, it&#x2019;ll be mostly San Diego against the Jets, again switching where necessary. That takes me to seven, when I&#x2019;m hoping you&#x2019;ll have dinner ready. From eight thirty to eleven thirty tonight is Dallas-Philadelphia on NBC; then, if I&#x2019;m lucky, you&#x2019;ll be in the mood for some sexual frolicking from eleven thirty until midnight.&#x201d; <br> <br>That is what I would say if I had any semblance of courage or honesty, but since I don&#x2019;t, I opt for, &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t really done a tap check for today yet, but I&#x2019;m sure I&#x2019;ll come up with something productive. Every day is a chance for a new adventure.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Then let me guess,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to take Tara for a walk, get some beer, place some bets, order a pizza, and watch football all day.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;You make it sound really appealing,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;How did you come up with all that?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s exactly what you did yesterday.&#x201d; <br> <br>I snap my fingers. &#x201c;I knew it sounded familiar. But yesterday was college football, today is pro. Apples and oranges.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re incorrigible.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Actually, I&#x2019;m partially corrigible.

Oh, and I&#x2019;m making the prison rounds Tuesday and Wednesday.&#x201d; Laurie knows what that means; I visit former clients of mine who were found guilty at trial and are in prison. I don&#x2019;t want them to think they&#x2019;ve been forgotten. <br> <br>&#x201c;So what do you have on tap for today?&#x201d; I ask, trying to pull the old switcheroo. <br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going running, then a spinning class, then Pilates, and then this afternoon I&#x2019;m volunteering at the hospital.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;You know, I can&#x2019;t decide which of those things sounds the most awful.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got an idea, Andy.&#x201d; <br> <br>Uh, oh. Laurie&#x2019;s ideas often involve my expending energy by actually doing things, and today I really just want to plant myself in front of the large-screen TV in the den. I&#x2019;m so looking forward to total relaxation that I bought a bag of already-popped popcorn so I don&#x2019;t have to deal with the microwave. <br> <br>&#x201c;I hope it&#x2019;s a long-range, down-the-road, futuristic kind of idea, because we&#x2019;re talking Giants-Redskins,&#x201d; I say. <br> <br>&#x201c;Well, it might be a way for you to really do something productive, something that you would also enjoy.&#x201d; She quickly adds, &#x201c;But definitely not today; I understand we&#x2019;re talking Giants-Redskins.&#x201d; <br> <br>My name, Andy Carpenter, is listed under &#x201c;Attorneys&#x201d; in the phone book, assuming phone books still exist. But since my desire to work is really low, and my bank account is really high, I haven&#x2019;t taken on any clients in almost six months, so I&#x2019;m a little leery about what Laurie might be driving at. &#x201c;As long as what you&#x2019;re going to suggest doesn&#x2019;t include judges, courthouses, depositions, or briefs, and if I can bring Tara, I&#x2019;m all ears,&#x201d; I say. <br> <br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t include any of those things, and Tara&#x2019;s actually the key to it.&#x201d; <br> <br>I relax the cringe I&#x2019;ve been doing since the conversation began. Tara is my best friend, right up there with Laurie. She is also a golden retriever, the greatest one on Earth. My interest is officially piqued. <br> <br>She continues, &#x201c;I think you should take Tara to the hospital as a therapy dog.&#x201d; <br> <br>This could be worse, but it ain&#x2019;t great. I know a little bit about the therapy dog process, and while I think it&#x2019;s a great thing to do, it&#x2019;s especially great for <i>other</i> people to do, with <i>other people&#x2019;s dogs</i>. <br> <br>I can&#x2019;t speak, or bark, for Tara, but I&#x2019;m not anxious to start spending time in hospitals. <br> <br>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t Tara need some special training for that?&#x201d; I ask. <br> <br>She shakes her head. &#x201c;Not this one; I&#x2019;ve checked it out. All they require is a mellow disposition and friendliness on the part of the dog, plus human compassion. Tara is mellow and friendly, and she has enough of the human compassion part for both of you.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Sounds great. But there must be a huge waiting list for something like that. I don&#x2019;t want to cut in line.&#x201d; <br> <br>Laurie shakes her head. &#x201c;Nope.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;And I suppose you&#x2019;ve already talked about it with Tara?&#x201d; <br> <br>She nods. &#x201c;She was quite enthusiastic about it.&#x201d; <br> <br>I look over at Tara, who does in fact seem fine with everything, and doesn&#x2019;t appear surprised. This has all the earmarks of a setup. <br> <br>I&#x2019;m not going to win this, so I might as well try to make it pay off. &#x201c;How is this going to impact my life sexually?&#x201d; I ask. <br> <br>Laurie smiles. &#x201c;I find the prospect of you doing this to be very erotic.&#x201d; <br> <br>I return the smile. &#x201c;My cup of human compassion runneth over.&#x201d; <br> <br>If I hadn&#x2019;t seen it, I wouldn&#x2019;t have believed it. <br> <br>I&#x2019;ve been in the hospital room occupied by the very frail Mrs. Harriet Marshall for thirty-five minutes. <br> <br>When I got here, she seemed barely awake, and her mumbling speech was impossible to understand. <br> <br>I told her who I was, and she showed no reaction whatsoever. I could have told her the room was on fire and I wouldn&#x2019;t have gotten a response. She was depressed, numbed, and mostly lifeless, sort of how I felt after the Redskins beat the Giants yesterday. <br> <br>She had absolutely no interest in me, had nothing to say to me, and barely acknowledged my existence. In terms of dealing with females, it felt like I was back in high school. <br> <br>Then Tara walked over to her, and everything changed. It took three or four minutes, during which Tara sniffed her and put her nose against her arm. <br> <br>Harriet resisted, until Tara pulled out the big move&nbsp;&#x2026; the combination &#x201c;lean-against nuzzle, with a slight lick and an adoring glance.&#x201d; In dog-land the move has a degree of difficulty of nine point seven, and as far as I know, there is no known defense against it. <br> <br>So within five minutes Harriet was petting Tara with both hands. She was using a &#x201c;reverse pet,&#x201d; which means she would stroke her head from front to back, and then from back to front. I know from personal experience that Tara is not a huge fan of that, but she was graciously allowing Harriet to do it. <br> <br>The transformation has been amazing. Harriet went from silent and sullen to outgoing and borderline gregarious. In fact, I don&#x2019;t think I could shut her up if I wanted to, which I don&#x2019;t. <br> <br>First, all she wanted to talk about was Tara, asking where I got her and whether she was always this sweet. I told her that I got her from an animal shelter seven years ago when she was two years old. <br>&#x201c;So she&#x2019;s only nine now?&#x201d; she asked. <br> <br>Unfortunately, &#x201c;only&#x201d; is not the appropriate word. Nine years is starting to get up there for a golden. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;though in dog years that&#x2019;s fifty-two,&#x201d; I said. Many people think that each year a dog lives counts as seven, but that&#x2019;s not the correct way to figure it. The first year counts as twenty-one, and each one thereafter counts as four. <br> <br>The entire concept would be depressing if not for the fact that Tara is going to live forever. <br> <br>&#x201c;Fifty-two? I&#x2019;ve got stockings older than that.&#x201d; Then she laughed, and I was immediately glad that I let Laurie talk me into do...</p><h2>Everything Is Obvious: How Common Sense Fails Us</h2><p><b>By understanding how and when common sense fails, we can improve our understanding of the present and better plan for the future.&nbsp;</b><br><br>Drawing on the latest scientific research, along with a wealth of historical and contemporary examples, Watts shows how common sense reasoning and history conspire to mislead us into believing that we understand more about the world of human behavior than we do; and in turn, why attempts to predict, manage, or manipulate social and economic systems so often go awry.<br><br>It seems obvious, for example, that people respond to incentives; yet policy makers and managers alike frequently fail to anticipate how people will respond to the incentives they create. Social trends often seem to be driven by certain influential people; yet marketers have been unable to identify these &#x201c;influencers&#x201d; in advance. And although successful products or companies always seem in retrospect to have succeeded because of their unique qualities, predicting the qualities of the next hit product or hot company is notoriously difficult even for experienced professionals.<br><br>Watts' argument has important implications in politics, business, and marketing, as well as in science and everyday life.</p><p><b>DUNCAN WATTS,</b> a principal research scientist at Microsoft Research, was a professor of sociology at Columbia University.

He lives in New York City.<br>&nbsp;<br>For more information visit www.everythingisobvious.comCHAPTER 1<br><br>The Myth of Common Sense<br><br>Every day in New York City five million people ride the subways. Starting from their homes throughout the boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx, they pour themselves in through hundreds of stations, pack themselves into thousands of cars that barrel though the dark labyrinth of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's tunnel system, and then once again flood the platforms and stairwells-a subterranean river of humanity urgently seeking the nearest exit and the open air beyond. As anyone who has ever participated in this daily ritual can attest, the New York subway system is something between a miracle and nightmare, a Rube Goldberg contraption of machines, concrete, and people that in spite of innumerable breakdowns, inexplicable delays, and indecipherable public announcements, more or less gets everyone where they're going, but not without exacting a certain amount of wear and tear on their psyche. Rush hour in particular verges on a citywide mosh pit-of tired workers, frazzled mothers, and shouting, shoving teenagers, all scrabbling over finite increments of space, time, and oxygen. It's not the kind of place you go in search of the milk of human kindness. It's not the kind of place where you'd expect a perfectly healthy, physically able young man to walk up to you and ask you for your seat.<br><br>And yet that's precisely what happened one day in the early 1970s when a group of psychology students went out into the subway system on the suggestion of their teacher, the social psychologist Stanley Milgram. Milgram was already famous for his controversial "obedience" studies, conducted some years earlier at Yale, in which he had shown that ordinary people brought into a lab would apply what they thought were deadly electrical shocks to a human subject (really an actor who was pretending to be shocked) simply because they were told to do so by a white-coated researcher who claimed to be running an experiment on learning. The finding that otherwise respectable citizens could, under relatively unexceptional circumstances, perform what seemed like morally incomprehensible acts was deeply disturbing to many people-and the phrase "obedience to authority" has carried a negative connotation ever since.1<br><br>What people appreciated less, however, is that following the instructions of authority figures is, as a general rule, indispensible to the proper functioning of society. Imagine if students argued with their teachers, workers challenged their bosses, and drivers ignored traffic cops anytime they asked them to do something they didn't like. The world would descend into chaos in about five minutes. Clearly there are moments when it's appropriate to resist authority, and most people would agree that the situation Milgram created in the lab would qualify as such a moment. But what the experiment also illustrated was that the social order that we take for granted in everyday life is maintained in part by hidden rules that we don't even realize exist until we try to break them.<br><br>Based on this experience, and having subsequently moved to New York, Milgram had begun to wonder if there was a similar "rule" about asking people for seats on the subway. Like the rule about obeying authority figures, this rule is never really articulated, nor would a typical rider be likely to mention it if asked to describe the rules of subway riding. And yet it exists, as Milgram's students quickly discovered when they went about their little field experiment. Although more than half of the riders asked eventually surrendered their seats, many of them reacted angrily or demanded some explanation for the request. Everyone reacted with surprise, even amazement, and onlookers often made disparaging remarks. But more interesting than the response of the riders was that of the experimenters themselves, who found it extremely difficult to perform the experiment in the first place. Their reluctance was so great, in fact, that they had to go out in pairs, with one of them acting as moral support for the other. When the students reported their discomfort to Milgram, he scoffed at them. But when he tried to do the experiment himself, the simple act of walking up to a complete stranger and asking for his or her seat left him feeling physically nauseated. As trivial as it seemed, in other words, this rule was no more easily violated than the obedience-to-authority "rule" that Milgram had exposed years earlier.2<br><br>As it turns out, a big city like New York is full of these sorts of rules. On a crowded train, for example, it's no big deal if you're squeezed in against other people. But if someone stands right next to you when the train is empty, it's actually kind of repellant. Whether it's acknowledged or not, there's clearly some rule that encourages us to spread out as much as we can in the available space, and violations of the rule can generate extreme discomfort. In the same way, imagine how uncomfortable you'd feel if someone got on your elevator and stood facing you instead of turning around to face the door. People face each other all the time in enclosed spaces, including on subway trains, and nobody thinks twice about it. But on an elevator it would feel completely weird, just as if the other person had violated some rule-even though it might not have occurred to you until that moment that any such rule existed. Or how about all the rules we follow for passing one another on the sidewalk, holding open doors, getting in line at the deli, acknowledging someone else's right to a cab, making just the right amount of eye contact with drivers as you cross the street at a busy intersection, and generally being considerate of our fellow human beings while still asserting our own right to take up a certain amount of space and time?<br><br>No matter where we live, our lives are guided and shaped by unwritten rules-so many of them, in fact, that we couldn't write them all down if we tried. Nevertheless, we expect reasonable people to know them all. Complicating matters, we also expect reasonable people to know which of the many rules that have been written down are OK to ignore. When I graduated from high school, for example, I joined the Navy and spent the next four years completing my officer training at the Australian Defence Force Academy. The academy back then was an intense place, replete with barking drill instructors, predawn push-ups, running around in the pouring rain with rifles, and of course lots and lots of rules. At first this new life seemed bizarrely complicated and confusing. However, we quickly learned that although some of the rules were important, to be ignored at your peril, many were enforced with something like a wink and a nod. Not that the punishments couldn't be severe. You could easily get sentenced to seven days of marching around a parade ground for some minor infraction like being late to a meeting or having a wrinkled bedcover. But what you were supposed to understand (although of course you weren't supposed to admit that you understood it) was that life at the academy was more<br><br>like a game than real life. Sometimes you won, and sometimes you lost, and that was when you ended up on the drill square; but whatever happened, you weren't supposed to take it personally. And sure enough, after about six months of acclimation, situations that would have terrified us on our arrival seemed entirely natural-it was now the rest of the world that seemed odd.<br><br>We've all had experiences like this. Maybe not quite as extreme as a military academy-which, twenty years later, sometimes strikes me as having happened in another life. But whether it's learning to fit in at a new school, or learning the ropes in a new job, or learning to live in a foreign country, we've all had to learn to negotiate new environments that at first seem strange and intimidating and filled with rules that we don't understand but eventually become familiar. Very often the formal rules-the ones that are written down-are less important than the informal rules, which just like the rule about subway seats may not even be articulated until we break them. Conversely, rules that we do know about may not be enforced, or may be enforced only sometimes depending on some other rule that we don't know about. When you think about how complex these games of life can be, it seems kind of amazing that we're capable of playing them at all. Yet, in the way that young children learn a new language seemingly by osmosis, we learn to navigate even the most novel social environments more or less without even knowing that we're doing it.<br><br>COMMON SENSE<br><br>The miraculous piece of human intelligence that enables us to solve these problems is what we call common sense. Common sense is so ordinary that we tend to notice it only when it's missing, but it is absolutely essential to functioning in everyday life. Common sense is how we know what to wear when we go to work in the morning, how to behave on the street or the subway, and how to maintain harmonious relationships with our friends and coworkers. It tells us when to obey the rules, when to quietly ignore them, and when to stand up and challenge the rules themselves. It is the essence of social intelligence, and is also deeply embedded in our legal system, in political philosophy, and in professional training.<br><br>For something we refer to so often, however, common sense is surprisingly hard to pin down.3 Roughly speaking, it is the loosely organized set of facts, observations, experiences, insights, and pieces of received wisdom that each of us accumulates over a lifetime, in the course of encountering, dealing with, and learning from, everyday situations. Beyond that, however, it tends to resist easy classification. Some commonsense knowledge is very general in nature-what the American anthropologist Clifford Geertz called an "ancient tangle of received practices, accepted beliefs, habitual judgments, and untaught emotions."4 But common sense can also refer to more specialized knowledge, as with the everyday working knowledge of a professional, such as a doctor, a lawyer, or an engineer, that develops over years of training and experience. In his address to the annual meeting of the American Sociological Society in Chicago in 1946, Carl Taylor, then president of the association, put it as well as anyone:<br><br>By common sense I mean the knowledge possessed by those who live in the midst and are a part of the social situations and processes which sociologists seek to understand. The term thus used may be synonymous with folk knowledge, or it may be the knowledge possessed by engineers, by the practical politicians, by those who gather and publish news, or by others who handle or work with and must interpret and predict the behavior or persons and groups.5<br><br>Taylor's definition highlights two defining features of common sense that seem to differentiate it from other kinds of human knowledge, like science or mathematics. The first of these features is that unlike formal systems of knowledge, which are fundamentally theoretical, common sense is overwhelmingly practical, meaning that it is more concerned with providing answers to questions than in worrying about how it came by the answers. From the perspective of common sense, it is good enough to know that something is true, or that it is the way of things. One does not need to know why in order to benefit from the knowledge, and arguably one is better off not worrying about it too much. In contrast with theoretical knowledge, in other words, common sense does not reflect on the world, but instead attempts to deal with it simply "as it is."6<br><br>The second feature that differentiates common sense from formal knowledge is that while the power of formal systems resides in their ability to organize their specific findings into logical categories described by general principles, the power of common sense lies in its ability to deal with every concrete situation on its own terms. For example, it is a matter of common sense that what we wear or do or say in front of our boss will be different from how we behave in front of our friends, our parents, our parents' friends, or our friends' parents. But whereas a formal system of knowledge would try to derive the appropriate behavior in all these situations from a single, more general "law," common sense just "knows" what the appropriate thing to do is in any particular situation, without knowing how it knows it.7 It is largely for this reason, in fact, that commonsense knowledge has proven so hard to replicate in computers-because, in contrast with theoretical knowledge, it requires a relatively large number of rules to deal with even a small number of special cases. Let's say, for example, that you wanted to program a robot to navigate the subway. It seems like a relatively simple task. But as you would quickly discover, even a single component of this task such as the "rule" against asking for another person's subway seat turns out to depend on a complex variety of other rules-about seating arrangements on subways in particular, about polite behavior in public in general, about life in crowded cities, and about general-purpose norms of courteousness, sharing, fairness, and ownership-that at first glance seem to have little to do with the rule in question.<br><br>Attempts to formalize commonsense knowledge have all encountered versions of this problem-that in order to teach a robot to imitate even a limited range of human behavior, you would have to, in a sense, teach it everything about the world. Short of that, the endless subtle distinctions between the things that matter, the things that are supposed to matter but don't, and the things that may or may not matter depending on other things, would always eventually trip up even the most sophisticated robot. As soon as it encountered a situation that was slightly different from those you had programmed it to handle, it would have no idea how to behave. It would stick out like a sore thumb. It would always be screwing up.8<br><br>People who lack common sense are a bit like the hapless robot in that they never seem to understand what it is that they should be paying attention to, and they never seem to understand what it is that they don't understand. And for exactly the same reason that programming robots is hard, it's surprisingly hard to explain to someone lacking in common sense what it is that they're doing wrong. You can take them back through various examples of when they said or did the wrong thing, and perhaps they'll be able to avoid making exactly those errors again. But as soon as anything is different, they're effectively back to square one. We had a few cadets like that at the academy: otherwise perfectly intelligent, competent people who just couldn't seem to figure out how to play the game.</p><h2>Alternate Currents Of High Potential And High Frequency</h2><p>An Illustrated, Unabridged Edition With Appendix (Transmission Of Electricity Without Wires) - Experiments With Alternate Currents Of High Potential And High Frequency: A Lecture Before The Institution Of Electrical Engineers, London, Including A Biographical Sketch Of The Author</p><p></p><h2>Igniting Darkness (Courting Darkness duology)</h2><p><b><b>From <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Robin LaFevers comes the follow up to&nbsp;</b>&#x201c;<b>sharp and breathless</b>&#x201d;<b>&nbsp;(<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>) historical fantasy <i>Courting Darkness.

This story, however, is&nbsp;brimming with evidence to the contrary--from roaring fires to grilled cheese sandwiches to toasty flannel pajamas. A unique twist on the traditional wintertime picture book,&nbsp;the beautiful visual narrative follows&nbsp;a boy and his family through a day of hot breakfasts, steaming afternoon cocoa, and a festive candlelit party before bed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its inviting scenes, poetic text,<i></i>and gorgeous illustrations,&nbsp;<i>Winter Is the Warmest Season</i> celebrates all the wonderful things that make winter the coziest time of the year.<br><br> &nbsp;</p><p>LAUREN STRINGER&nbsp;is the award-winning author and illustrator of <i>Winter is the Warmest Season</i> and the illustrator of many other picture books.&nbsp;She lives with her family in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Visit her at www.laurenstringer.com*Starred Review* Winter? Cold? It's all in the way you look at things as this imaginative book makes clear. A boy proclaims that summer notwithstanding, his world is warmest in winter. His puffy jacket is cozy, and a fire burns in the fireplace. Comparisons between summer and winter come in clever pairs: jelly sandwiches turn into grilled cheese; cool swims turn into hot baths. Nor is it just the boy who feels the difference: the cat cuddles on laps instead of stretching out on the windowsill. In a linguistic rhapsody, the boy explains how "sleeping radiators awake to their dragon selves, banging and hissing and pouring heat." It takes special art to accentuate the evocative words, and Stringer, who has illustrated many books for others, provides distinctive pictures for herself. With fascinating perspectives that sometimes start on the ceiling, the deeply hued acrylic artwork ranges from friendly to joyous, as in a two-page spread of a party filled with fun and music. A special book worthy of many readings, this radiates warmth. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Dismissed by the big-city capos, the DeCavalcantes finally came into their own when they found their lives mirrored in the television hit, <b>The Sopranos</b>. Overnight it legitimized the made men of the Garden State. Now they were a familia to be reckoned with. Unfortunately with high profile came high risk. As member turned against member, as trusted friend turned terrified informant, the FBI put the brakes on the DeCavalcante&#x2019;s explosive ride into infamy, hastening a fall from honor that would become as infamous as their notorious ascension into the annals of organized crime. <p>Based on more than 1,000 hours of secretly recorded conversations, <b>Made Men</b> delivers for the first time, the unprecedented and completely uncensored behind-the-scenes truth of a historically clandestine world&#x2014;of violent life and sudden death inside and outside the mob, told by the very men who made it.</p></p><p>Greg B. Smith, reporter for New York&#x2019;s <b>Daily News</b>, covers the federal courts in Brooklyn and Manhattan that serve as Ground Zero in the battle to end mafia influence in America. An investigative reporter for nearly twenty years, Smith has written for <b>The Boston Globe, The San Francisco Examiner, The Seattle Post-Intelligencer</b>, and other newspapers around the country. He&#x2019;s also a frequent guest on TV and radio discussing everything from racketeering to the Latin Kings street gang to world terrorist organizations. Mr. Smith lives with his wife and two boys in Brooklyn, New York.Based on more than 1000 hours of secretly recorded conversations, this book tells the story of New Jersey's DeCavalcante crime family. Originally dismissed by the large New York City crime organizations, the DeCavalcantes sought the opportunity to move up in the crime world when their big-city counterparts began having legal troubles and when The Sopranos, which recounts the life of a fictional Jersey mob family, became such a hit on HBO. Unfortunately for the DeCavalcantes, they had been infiltrated by an FBI informant. Although the show's creator has denied it, much of The Sopranos is said to be based on this real-life crime family, and DeCavalcante members were even caught on federal wiretaps bragging about their similarity to the TV mobsters. But while Daily News mob reporter Smith draws many parallels between the DeCavalcantes and the fictional Sopranos, the book does not quite live up to its potential. Much of the writing seems disjointed and repetitious, and a few superfluous anecdotes scattered throughout seem to have little relevance to the rest of the story.

The focus of Creole New Orleans is on the development of a colonial Franco-African culture in the city, the ways that culture was influenced by the arrival of later immigrants, and the processes that led to the eventual dominance of the Anglo-American community.</p><p>Essays in the book's first section focus not only on the formation of the curiously blended Franco-African culture but also on how that culture, once established, resisted change and allowed New Orleans to develop along French and African creole lines until the early nineteenth century. Jerah Johnson explores the motives and objectives of Louisiana's French founders, giving that issue the most searching analysis it has yet received. Gwendolyn Midlo Hall, in her account of the origins of New Orleans' free black population, offers a new approach to the early history of Africans in colonial Louisiana.</p><p>The second part of the book focuses on the challenge of incorporating New Orleans into the United States. As Paul F. LaChance points out, the French immigrants who arrived after the Louisiana Purchase slowed the Americanization process by preserving the city's creole culture. Joesph Tregle then presents a clear, concise account of the clash that occurred between white creoles and the many white Americans who during the 1800s migrated to the city. His analysis demonstrates how race finally brought an accommodation between the white creole and American leaders.</p><p>The third section centers on the evolution of the city's race relations during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Joseph Logsdon and Caryn Coss� Bell begin by tracing the ethno-cultural fault line that divided black Americans and creole through Reconstruction and the emergence of Jim Crow. Arnold R. Hirsch pursues the themes discerned by Logsdon and Bell from the turn of the century to the 1980s, examining the transformation of the city's racial politics.</p><p>Collectively, these essays fill a major void in Louisiana history while making a significant contribution to the history of urbanization, ethnicity, and race relations. The book will serve as a cornerstone for future study of the history of New Orleans.</p></p><p><p><b>Arnold R. Hirsch </b>is Ethel and Herman L.

Wasn&#x2019;t there a time once when it was clear and straightforward? Are we lost?</p><p>Dudes, look around you: The trail we once traveled from boyhood to maturity is now so overgrown, it&#x2019;s almost impossible to trace. Our vision is blurred, rendering the map that previous generations followed unreadable. Our compass needles are spinning in circles, making navigation impossible.

We need not settle for wandering aimlessly through our days, wounded, weak, and passive.

If there&nbsp;was going to be a race to collect an ancient trea sure in&nbsp;the modern world of 1943, the winner wasn&#x2019;t going to&nbsp;be the guy who sailed &#x2019;round the Horn on a clipper ship&nbsp;to find it. Flying was a sharp knife in any field archaeologist&#x2019;s&nbsp;tool chest&#x2014; but because planes were <i>necessary&nbsp;</i>didn&#x2019;t mean he had to like the blasted things. Or trust&nbsp;them. Oh, sure, mostly they flew just fine. Sometimes&nbsp;they didn&#x2019;t. After the third or fourth time one came&nbsp;down hard enough to blow out the tires or break the&nbsp;undercarriage, he was less trusting. Yeah, you did what&nbsp;you had to do to get where you needed to get. Someday&nbsp;your number was going to be up no matter what you&nbsp;did. No point in worrying about it too much, but . . .&nbsp;flying around like a bird?&nbsp;<br><br>Because of his OSS training, Indy knew more about&nbsp;aircraft than he wanted to know, and this one&#x2014; a&nbsp;Taylor/Piper J-2 that looked a lot older than it could&nbsp;possibly be&#x2014; seemed to be held together with baling&nbsp;wire and prayer. It was noisy, underpowered&#x2014; a&nbsp;forty- horsepower engine was stock, it weighed a little&nbsp;over 500 pounds empty, and with Mac, who had to go&nbsp;210, and Indy at about 190? That was the maximum&nbsp;cargo capacity right there. Raul, the little Cuban pi lot,&nbsp;was small, but even he had to go 140, and that didn&#x2019;t&nbsp;count the weight of the fuel and what luggage they&nbsp;had, and all that meant this plane ought not to be able&nbsp;to get off the ground. Yet here they were, cruising two&nbsp;thousand feet above the Ca rib be an, at all of sixty miles&nbsp;an hour. Yeah, Raul said he had rebuilt the engine and&nbsp;perked it up a fair bit, but even so, that it had taken off&nbsp;three times with them so far? That was still amazing&#x2014;&nbsp;They say that bad thoughts draw the dev il&#x2019;s attention.&nbsp;The engine sputtered, was silent for what seemed&nbsp;like a thousand years but was probably only a second,&nbsp;and Indy&#x2019;s belly roiled as if it contained a most&nbsp;unhappy lizard trying to get out. The imaginary creature&nbsp;wasn&#x2019;t too choosy about its exit route, trying to&nbsp;go up and down at the same time . . .&nbsp;<br><br>Indiana Jones said a word that would have gotten his&nbsp;mouth washed out with soap in polite family circles.&nbsp;Mac laughed.&nbsp;<br><br>The pi lot said something in rapid Cuban Spanish,&nbsp;and he laughed, too.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;He said&#x2014;&#x201d; Mac began.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I heard him,&#x201d; Indy said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sitting right <i>here, </i>third&nbsp;guy in a two- seater, and since I know there is no aerodynamic&nbsp;way this thing can stay up, he <i>better </i>have an&nbsp;in with the Virgin Mary.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;You worry too much.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;And you don&#x2019;t worry enough.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Mac&#x2014;George McHale&#x2014; was British to the core, and&nbsp;MI6. He and Indy had been paired on a dozen secret&nbsp;assignments for either His Majesty&#x2019;s government or&nbsp;Uncle Sam, mostly in Eu rope, a couple in the Pacific,&nbsp;and while Mac was a good man to have covering your&nbsp;back, he was also prone to recklessness. Indy had saved&nbsp;Mac&#x2019;s bacon more often than the other way around,&nbsp;though he did have Mac to thank for keeping him alive&nbsp;a few times&#x2014; and his recent increase in rank. That latter&nbsp;was a mixed blessing. Indy hadn&#x2019;t even wanted to be&nbsp;in <i>one </i>army, much less <i>two </i>of them, and he had just&nbsp;gotten used to being &#x201c;Major Jones&#x201d; in one of them, and&nbsp;now he was a light colonel.&nbsp;<br><br>Well. In an odd, technical sort of way he was a&nbsp;colonel . . .&nbsp;<br><br>The engine coughed again.&nbsp;<br><br>This time, Indy managed to keep from cursing.&nbsp;In Spanish, Raul said, &#x201c;Not far now, se�ors, only a&nbsp;couple of miles to the coast there.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Indy had to lean to his right to see through the windshield,&nbsp;and the act of doing so caused the little plane to&nbsp;bank.&nbsp;<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t say anything, but Raul must have noticed&nbsp;how quickly he leaned back the other way.&nbsp;<br><br>Raul&#x2014;or maybe it was Indy&#x2014; straightened the plane&nbsp;out. &#x201c;Rosita is very sensitive, se�or.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Sensitive? A plane that you could turn by <i>leaning</i>?&nbsp;Indy shook his head. At least they had made it this far.&nbsp;They had taken off from Santiago, Cuba, flying to&nbsp;Guantanamo, then to a landing strip hacked out of a&nbsp;sugarcane field outside Baraco. They had refueled and&nbsp;then started over the Windward Passage, the strait&nbsp;that connected the Atlantic and the Ca rib be an, heading&nbsp;toward Mole Saint- Nicolas in Haiti. There was&nbsp;supposedly a runway and a fuel tank there at which&nbsp;they could gas up for the hop into Saint- Marc, and yet&nbsp;another fuel stop, before the final leg to Port- au- Prince.&nbsp;Maybe somebody would want to see a passport or&nbsp;visa, but Raul didn&#x2019;t think it likely. The war and all,&nbsp;who had time to stand around waiting because a plane&nbsp;<i>might </i>land?&nbsp;<br><br>The J-2 had a range of only a couple of hundred&nbsp;miles, but it was what Mac had found. The &#x201c;war and&nbsp;all&#x201d; had sucked up a lot of available aircraft, along,&nbsp;apparently, with border patrolmen.&nbsp;<br><br>Indy looked at Mac. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why I let you&nbsp;talk me into this. We need the rest. It&#x2019;s why they gave&nbsp;us the furlough.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Mac smiled. &#x201c;Because, Jonesy, you are a dedicated&nbsp;archaeologist, right? How could you pass up a chance&nbsp;like this? What if the Nazis or the Japa nese got there&nbsp;first? Then that bloody giant black pearl would be buying&nbsp;jackboots for Adolf or maybe a sub for the emperor.&#x201d;&nbsp;Indy didn&#x2019;t want to say it but couldn&#x2019;t stop himself:&nbsp;&#x201c;Haiti is tropical. Crawling with snakes.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Actually, old chum, they aren&#x2019;t any of them poisonous&nbsp;in these parts, you know.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, yippee for that. It&#x2019;s not the poison, Mac, it&#x2019;s&nbsp;the . . . <i>snakiness</i>.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>Mac laughed again.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t think it so funny if it was rats,&#x201d; Indy&nbsp;allowed.&nbsp;<br><br>Mac&#x2019;s smile disappeared. &#x201c;Bloody Germans!&#x201d;&nbsp;<i><br><br>Gotcha, </i>Indy thought. Mac was like Indy&#x2019;s father&#x2014;&nbsp;he hated rodents. He felt pretty good about that comeback.&nbsp;That thing with the rats in the Nazi castle&#x2014;&nbsp;<br><br>The plane&#x2019;s little engine went <i>sput- sput- sput! </i>and&nbsp;died.&nbsp;<br><br>It got very quiet.&nbsp;<br><br>The engine didn&#x2019;t come back on.&nbsp;<br><br>The plane started to drop.&nbsp;<br><br>Raul began praying to the Virgin Mary.&nbsp;<br><br>Laden as the craft was, the glide pattern suddenly&nbsp;seemed more like that of a brick than a plane.&nbsp;<br><br>Indy tightened the tie holding his whip onto his belt,&nbsp;made sure his Webley&#x2019;s holster was snapped shut.&nbsp;&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s my hat?&#x201d; he said, looking around&#x2014;&nbsp;<br><br>The sea, which had been a comfortable two thousand&nbsp;feet below, rushed toward them. It was only a&nbsp;hundred yards or so away now and coming up fast.&nbsp;They were, if they were lucky, going to ditch. If not,&nbsp;they&#x2019;d go straight in and blow apart on impact.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;If I die and you don&#x2019;t, I&#x2019;m coming back to haunt&nbsp;you, Mac.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>He braced himself.&nbsp;<br><br>The plane hit the water&#x2014;&nbsp;<br><br>The jolt clacked Indy&#x2019;s teeth together as his body&nbsp;snapped forward against the seat belt. The plane&nbsp;skipped once, like a rubber ball bouncing off concrete.&nbsp;The right wing tore loose, the pi lot&#x2019;s door ripped away,&nbsp;and Indy saw the windshield shatter as Raul&#x2019;s belt&nbsp;broke and his head went through the glass.&nbsp;<br><br>They bounced and jostled over the water like a&nbsp;skipped stone, hard enough to break up more of the&nbsp;plane&#x2014;&nbsp;<br><br>Finally, they stopped moving foward. The water&nbsp;rushed in, filling the little craft, which began to sink.&nbsp;&#x201c;Out!&#x201d; Indy yelled.&nbsp;<br><br>Mac was already moving.</p><h2>The Divide: American Injustice in the Age of the Wealth Gap</h2><p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER � NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY <i>THE WASHINGTON POST,</i>&nbsp;NPR, AND <i>KIRKUS REVIEWS</i><br><br>A scathing portrait of an urgent new American crisis</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Over the last two decades, America has been falling deeper and deeper into a statistical mystery:<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Poverty goes up. Crime goes down. The prison population doubles.</i><br> <i>Fraud by the rich wipes out 40 percent of the world&#x2019;s wealth. The rich get massively richer. No one goes to jail.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> In search of a solution, journalist Matt Taibbi discovered the Divide, the seam in American life where our two most troubling trends&#x2014;growing wealth inequality and mass incarceration&#x2014;come together, driven by a dramatic shift in American citizenship: Our basic rights are now determined by our wealth or poverty. The Divide is what allows massively destructive fraud by the hyperwealthy to go unpunished, while turning poverty itself into a crime&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s impossible to see until you look at these two alarming trends side by side.<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>The Divide, </i>Matt Taibbi takes readers on a galvanizing journey through both sides of our new system of justice&#x2014;the fun-house-mirror worlds of the untouchably wealthy and the criminalized poor. He uncovers the startling looting that preceded the financial collapse; a wild conspiracy of billionaire hedge fund managers to destroy a company through dirty tricks; and the story of a whistleblower who gets in the way of the largest banks in America, only to find herself in the crosshairs. On the other side of the Divide, Taibbi takes us to the front lines of the immigrant dragnet; into the newly punitive welfare system which treats its beneficiaries as thieves; and deep inside the stop-and-frisk world, where standing in front of your own home has become an arrestable offense. As he narrates these incredible stories, he draws out and analyzes their common source: a perverse new standard of justice, based on a radical, disturbing new vision of civil rights.<br> &nbsp;<br> Through astonishing&#x2014;and enraging&#x2014;accounts of the high-stakes capers of the wealthy and nightmare stories of regular people caught in the Divide&#x2019;s punishing logic, Taibbi lays bare one of the greatest challenges we face in contemporary American life: surviving a system that devours the lives of the poor, turns a blind eye to the destructive crimes of the wealthy, and implicates us all.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>The Divide</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br>&#x201c;Ambitious . . . deeply reported, highly compelling . . . impossible to put down.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2014;The New York Times Book Review</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;These are the stories that will keep you up at night. . . . <i>The Divide</i> is not just a report from the new America; it is advocacy journalism at its finest.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2014;Los Angeles Times</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Taibbi is a relentless investigative reporter.

I&#x2019;m in a cramped, twelfth-story closet of a courtroom, squeezed onto a wooden bench full of heavily perspiring lawyers and onlookers, watching something truly rare in the annals of modern American criminal justice&#x2014;the prosecution of a bank.<br><br>The set for this curiosity is the city&#x2019;s 100 Centre Street courthouse, a beat-up old building located far downtown, just a stone&#x2019;s throw from the thicket of gleaming skyscrapers housing the great financial powers of Wall Street.<br><br>It&#x2019;s a pretrial hearing. The defendants&#x2014;nineteen individuals plus the corporation itself&#x2014;are here today to argue a motion to dismiss. There&#x2019;s no press here that I can see, despite the historic moment. And it is historic. This case, filed by New York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., represents the only prosecution of a bank to take place anywhere in America since the collapse of the world economy in 2008. (In fact, it&#x2019;s the first since the early 1990s.)<br><br>So who&#x2019;s the defendant? Is it Citigroup? Goldman Sachs? Wells Fargo? JPMorgan Chase? Bank of America? After all, these companies had all been involved in countless scandals since the financial crisis of &#x2019;08, a disaster caused by an epidemic of criminal fraud that wiped out some 40 percent of the world&#x2019;s wealth in less than a year, affecting nearly everyone in the industrialized world. If ever there was a wave of white-collar crime that cried out for a criminal trial, it was this period of fraud from the mid-2000s. And it would make sense that the defendants should come from one of these companies. In the years since the crash, all of them, and a half-dozen more too-big-to-fail megafirms just like them, had already paid hundreds of millions of dollars in civil settlements for virtually every kind of fraud and manipulation known to man.<br><br>Moreover, District Attorney Vance had once seemingly had all these Wall Street firms in his sights. He&#x2019;d sent subpoenas out to Goldman and other companies the previous year. So surely one of these banks in those big skyscrapers a few blocks south of here must be the one on trial.<br><br>Nope. In the end, the one bank to get thrown on the dock was not a Wall Street firm but one housed in the opposite direction, a little to the north&#x2014;a tiny family-owned community bank in Chinatown called Abacus Federal Savings Bank.<br><br>As a symbol of the government&#x2019;s ambitions in the area of cleaning up the financial sector, Abacus presents a striking picture. Instead of a fifty-story glass-and-steel monolith, Abacus is housed in a dull gray six-story building wedged between two noodle shops at the southern end of New York&#x2019;s legendary Bowery, once the capital of American poverty.<br><br>This is the bank in court today, dragged to the cross to take the blame for the many sins of the financial sector. It is a grimly comic scene. The judge, the Honorable Renee White, is a legendary city curmudgeon, a wraithlike woman with a long turtlish neck and orange hair who seems unhappy not only to be listening to a motion to dismiss but to be on planet Earth at all.<br><br>Before the hearing began, in fact, she&#x2019;d barked at a young Chinese woman who&#x2019;d had the audacity to dip her head near the floor to sneak a drink from a water bottle in her bag, trying to fight off the stultifying heat. &#x201c;No refreshments!&#x201d; the judge yelled. &#x201c;You should have had your lunch before you came to this courtroom!&#x201d;<br><br>The young woman meekly put her bottle back into a bag. Judge White craned her long neck and glared. A burly bailiff, acting as many bailiffs do&#x2014;as the physical manifestation of his judge&#x2019;s whimsy&#x2014;hovered angrily past to make sure the offending bottle was no longer visible.<br><br>&#x201c;Is she always like this?&#x201d; I whispered, to no one in particular.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you talking about?&#x201d; a lawyer in front of me answered. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s in a good mood today.&#x201d;<br><br>Judge White frowned and then went about the dreary task of reseating the courtroom. She sent Cantonese-speaking defendants to her left, Mandarin-speaking defendants to the right, and had a single translator plopped into the middle of each bewildered group.<br><br>Some of the accused were low-level loan officers, immigrants mostly, who had been as young as twenty-one or as old as seventy at the time of arrest. None of them were what one would describe as wealthy persons. None were millionaire CEOs of the Jamie Dimon/Lloyd Blankfein ilk. Instead, they were mostly Chinese immigrants in cheap blouses and worn suits, people who spoke little English or none at all, and who looked white with shame and confusion as they huddled around their respective translators.<br><br>Many of these criminal masterminds had been earning as little as $35,000 a year at the time they were hauled in for what the state described as a far-reaching scheme to falsify loan applications for home mortgages that their bank, Abacus, ultimately went on to sell to the government-sponsored mortgage dealer, Fannie Mae.<br><br>What were these nineteen people charged with? The case had been sold to the court and to the public&#x2014;by Vance, mostly&#x2014;as having something to do with the financial crisis, setting up the bank as a scapegoat for the 2008 blowup. Vance bragged that it was the first indictment in New York of a bank since the BCCI crisis in 1991, and he subtly compared Abacus to the aforementioned bailout all-stars like Citigroup and Bank of America, ostensibly the true villains of the financial crisis, by warning that Abacus&#x2019;s crimes might ultimately lead to the taxpayer footing the bill. &#x201c;If we&#x2019;ve learned anything from the recent mortgage crisis,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s that at some point, these schemes will unravel and taxpayers could be left holding the bag.&#x201d;<br><br>Vance made sure to play rough with the defendants, just to let them know how angry The People were about the financial crisis. In an extraordinary scene over a year before, on May 31, 2012, Vance had hauled all nineteen of the Abacus defendants into court to face indictment. For the benefit of the press, he had them chained not only at the hands and feet but to one another.<br><br>This otherworldly chain gang of bewildered immigrants had been led into the courtroom like a giant, slow-moving snake. It was like a scene out of Bagram or Guant�namo Bay&#x2014;all that was missing were the hoods.<br><br>Incredibly, three of the nineteen people who were put in chains had already been arraigned by Vance and released on bail. Prosecutors had asked them to voluntarily report to court that day, and they came, having no idea what for. When they appeared, Vance had had them cuffed and chained all over again, then paraded into court to be rearraigned, purely for the benefit of the cameras.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m no softie on crime,&#x201d; says Kevin Puvalowski, the attorney for Abacus and a former federal drug prosecutor. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;ve seen death penalty defendants treated with more dignity.&#x201d;<br><br>Again, on the same day as this bizarre photo op, Vance had stood up in a press conference and described the indictment of Abacus as a direct blow against the behavior that had caused the financial crisis. &#x201c;The lessons of the financial crisis are still being learned,&#x201d; he said sternly.<br><br>And in its limited coverage of the case, the press mostly upheld the notion that the Abacus indictment was aimed at the heart of the financial crisis. &#x201c;The indictment against the bank and its employees describes the sort of scheme that led to the financial crisis of 2008,&#x201d; wrote The New York Times in a typical account, &#x201c;when the risk of mortgages to borrowers was disguised and passed on to investors.&#x201d;<br><br>As for Vance, he got what he wanted out of the presser: a trophy. In subsequent coverage in newspapers like The Wall Street Journal, he would henceforth be referred to as the DA who &#x201c;indicted a bank for mortgage fraud.&#x201d;<br><br>But this case had nothing to do with the financial crisis. In fact, it was clear just from reading the indictment that the improprieties uncovered at Abacus were highly idiosyncratic and specific to Chinatown&#x2019;s immigrant population. Though tax evasion wasn&#x2019;t part of the case, it lurked in the background. Clearly, many mortgage applicants, who worked in cash businesses in the immigrant Chinese community, had not wanted to declare all their income.<br><br>After the Abacus indictment, in fact, I heard whispers from a police source with long experience in Chinatown that some of the bank&#x2019;s customers may have been involved in schemes like trademark counterfeiting&#x2014;not exactly a surprise, since it&#x2019;s hard to visit Chinatown and not run into someone selling phony Prada bags or Rolex watches out of the back of a van somewhere.<br><br>Thus the underlying crime in this case seemed to be that Abacus&#x2019;s customers could afford to pay for a mortgage but didn&#x2019;t want to say how, exactly. They had been, in other words, not overreporting but underreporting their incomes.<br><br>There was also a bizarre racial component to the case. Buried in the charges was the thinly veiled assumption that Abacus senior management encouraged their borrowers to commit fraud in their applications because they knew they could rely upon the generally accepted cultural proposition that Chinese people, like the evil Lannisters in Game of Thrones, always pay their debts. Vance&#x2019;s indictment more or less says this out loud, claiming that Abacus manage�ment &#x201c;falsely told employees that the exceptionally low default rate of Abacus-originated loans made the underlying accuracy of loan documents insignificant.&#x201d;<br><br>The description had been true&#x2014;the Abacus mortgage holders had paid their debts. In fact, from the date of the first offense as defined by the prosecutors, the quasi-governmental Fannie Mae had made a profit of $220 million on Abacus-issued home loans. In all, Abacus had one of the lowest default rates in the entire country. It was about 0.5 percent, roughly ten times better than the average.<br><br>Thus this was a very different kind of case from the more common fraud of the financial crisis era, which mostly involved gigantic banks and mortgage lenders selling the toxic and ultimately worthless subprime mortgage loans of broke and underemployed middle Americans as AAA-rated investments to state pension funds, foreign trade unions, and other suckers. Abacus was almost certainly a case about hiding income; the financial crisis was caused by a snake-oil scheme to sell worthless loans as gold.<br><br>Everyone got what they wanted from the Abacus prosecution. The city got to say it was being tough on financial crime. The press got to run a thrilling picture of harsh justice. Vance got a line to add to his r�sum�. The only losers were the public, who had no idea that the real culprits for the financial crisis were being set free, while the bank on trial had nothing to do with the losses that had been suffered by almost every ordinary American in the crash. As one city investigator put it, Abacus was &#x201c;the Lee Harvey Oswald of banks&#x2014; a patsy.&#x201d;<br><br>In any case, this same collection of freaked-out immigrant patsies were back in court now, this time without their chains. Most of the defendants had their own lawyers, as did the bank itself, so the courtroom was fairly packed with defense counsel. Most of these defense lawyers had filed &#x201c;Clayton motions,&#x201d; a New York state legal procedure in which a defendant can ask a judge to dismiss charges on the general grounds that doing so would be in furtherance of justice.<br><br>Among other things, a Clayton motion asks the judge to consider &#x201c;the purpose and effect&#x201d; of punishment and the &#x201c;impact on the public interest&#x201d; of a dismissal. They are motions, in other words, that ask a judge to consider the consequences of prosecution, balanced against the public interest.<br><br>One by one, defense counsel stood up to argue to the ostentatiously bored Judge White why their clients should be let go. Some argued their clients were too old or too young, or had been at the bank for only a few months, or had never in their whole lives been in trouble with the law. (They virtually all argued that.) Some said their clients had been new on the job and had simply filled out a few papers incorrectly according to the instructions of superiors. The list of reasons for leniency went on and on.<br><br>But finally one of the defense lawyers, a former city prosecutor named Sanford &#x201c;Sam&#x201d; Talkin, a man with a deep tan and a neatly shaven head, got to a larger and more dangerous point. Gently waving a hand in the direction of the Abacus defendants, Talkin confronted Judge White. &#x201c;Your Honor,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I want you to compare them to Citigroup. Just last week Citigroup settled for $968 million for either underperforming or defaulted home loans. . . .<br><br>&#x201c;But this pales in comparison to Bank of America, which paid $6.8 billion dollars, with a b, for underperforming or defaulted home loans. Civil settlement, no criminal charges . . . Wells Fargo Bank, $3.3 billion, no criminal prosecution . . . Ally GMAC, $3.3 billion, civil settlement, no criminal charges. JPMorgan Chase . . . another $3.3 billion for the same purpose, civil settlement, no criminal charges.&#x201d;</p><h2>Wicked Autumn: A Max Tudor Novel (A Max Tudor Novel, 1)</h2><p><p><b>One of <i>The Boston Globe</i>'s Best Mysteries of 2011 </b><br><b>One of <i>Library Journal</i>'s Best Mystery Books of 2011 </b></p><p><b>"Hugely funny, exquisitely well written, a tongue-in-cheek village mystery to be savored.

This quaint town seems to be the perfect new home for Max, who has fled a harrowing past serving in the British counter-intelligence agency, the MI5. Now he has found a measure of peace among urban escapees and yoga practitioners, artists and New Agers. But this serenity is quickly shattered when the highly vocal and unpopular president of the Women's Institute turns up dead at the Harvest Fayre. The death looks like an accident, but Max's training as a former agent kicks in, and before long he suspects foul play. </p><p>Max has ministered to the community long enough to be familiar with alliances and animosities among the residents, but this tragedy confounds him. It is impossible to believe anyone in his lovely hamlet capable of the crime, and yet given the victim, he must acknowledge that almost everyone in town had probably fantasized about the poor woman's death. As Max becomes more intricately involved, the investigation stirs up memories he'd rather not revisit; the demons from his past which led him to Nether Monkslip and the reason why he is so heavily invested in keeping it from harm. </p><p>Agatha-award winning author G.M.

M. MALLIET&#x2019;s first St. Just mystery won the 2008 Agatha Award for Best First Novel, and was chosen by <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> as a best book of the year. It was nominated for many awards, including the Anthony, the Macavity, and a Left Coast Crime award for best police procedural. Her subsequent mysteries and short stories have been nominated for nearly every major crime-writing award. Critics rave that she "may be the best mystery author writing in English at the moment (along with Tana French). She's certainly the most entertaining...." (<i>Cleveland.com</i>). She and her husband live in the US and travel often to the UK, the setting for all her books.<i>CHAPTER 1</i><br><br><i>The Women</i><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Wanda Batton-Smythe, head of the Women&#x2019;s Institute of Nether Monkslip, liked to say she was not one to mince words. She might add that she was always one to call a spade a spade, and that what more people needed was simply to pull their socks up and get on with it. She was saying these things now&#x2014;calling on all the resources in her clich� lineup, in fact&#x2014;to a captive audience of approximately thirty-five women who, to a woman, were wishing themselves elsewhere than in the Village Hall, sitting on orange molded-plastic seats that might have been rejects from an ergonomics study, on an otherwise peaceful Saturday night in September.<br>Reports of members present and apologies for absence received (Miss Pitchford had a head cold) had already been swiftly recorded. The women had stood to sing the traditional &#x201c;Jerusalem,&#x201d; if at a somewhat faster tempo than was customary. Still, they had reached this night a deep, throaty trill on &#x201c;Bring me my chariot of fire!&#x201d;&#x2014;for so many, a favorite line, unifying the straying or hesitant warblers into a mighty whole&#x2014;before the effort collapsed again at &#x201c;I will not cease from mental fight.&#x201d;<br>Finally, reports from the Flower Show and Guy Fawkes committees had been rushed through in unseemly haste, lest they detract from the main event: Wanda Batton-Smythe&#x2019;s address to the troops.<br>The men of the village, upholding a time-honored tradition in the division of labor, were of course safely ensconced amongst the gleaming brass and cheery glow of the nearby Hidden Fox pub.<br>&#x201c;I am, as you know, not one to mince words, and you can always count on me to call a spade a spade,&#x201d; Wanda reminded them, her voice filling the room like a sonic gun. &#x201c;The preparations for the annual Harvest Fayre are in an absolute <i>shambles</i>. We have all <i>got</i> to start pulling our socks up.&#x201d;<br>Calling on her knowledge of public speaking, newly refreshed by a rereading of the 1983 classic <i>Grabbing Your Audience by the Throat: Tips and Tricks for the Successful Orator</i>, Wanda paused, her unblinking gaze panning the crowd, gathering eyeballs like so many marbles into her rhetorical basket.<br>&#x201c;A shambles,&#x201d; she repeated, a doomsday prophetess. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s an absolute disgrace.&#x201d;<br>Lily Iverson, rightly assuming part of this condemnation to be aimed starkly at her small head, began a stuttering apology, but in such a small voice as to be easily drowned out by Wanda&#x2019;s stentorian tones. It was a bullying technique nicely honed during Wanda&#x2019;s time in the trenches of the parish council meetings, where skirmishes over the proposed redesign of the coat of arms had become the stuff of legend. The name Wanda Batton-Smythe indeed was often invoked by young parents in warnings aimed at keeping their offspring in line, for she had become for many an embodiment of fear, a veritable bogeywoman.<br>Wanda now stood before the group, marshaling her resources for further onslaught, her broad, still-handsome face framed by a starchy collar over a dark summer wool dress that Cotton Mather would have approved. Her hair was a helmet of hardened curls, like rows of teeny brown snakes highlighted and poised to strike, living testament to the efficacy of Final Net, and her bosom was tightly bound in some unmoving modern wonder fabric that rendered her body rigid and unbowing, much like her mind. The gray eyes again scanned her audience like an advance scout awaiting the approach of enemy forces. Altogether she looked, as always, more like a woman gearing up for battle than the leader of a group of well-intentioned if somewhat loopy volunteers. Much of her life with her husband the Major, as well as her own service in the Women&#x2019;s Royal Army Corps, had rubbed off.<br>&#x201c;Wanda, I don&#x2019;t think&#x2014;&#x201d; began Suzanna Winship, the willowy blond sister of the local doctor, coming to the defense of Lily, whose lower lip had begun to tremble around her adult braces. Wrapped in a fluffy white mohair dress of her own design (Lily owned a local yarn and knitting business), her hair clipped short around protuberant ears, she resembled a Chihuahua puppy abandoned in a snowdrift.<br>Wanda pounced.<br>&#x201c;You have not asked to be recognized, nor have you been given permission to speak.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Permission to speak?&#x201d; Suzanna spluttered, looking round her: <i>Did anyone else find Wanda ridiculous?</i> They did, but no one had the courage to indicate so by word or deed, at least not to Wanda&#x2019;s face. Suzanna was new to the village. She&#x2019;d learn.<br>Elka Garth, a grandmotherly woman in her fifties who owned the village bakery-slash-tearoom, did exhale a soft little sigh, adjusting her thick glasses and wishing the Reverend Max Tudor would hurry up and marry so his wife might take on the role traditionally allotted to those in her position. A palace coup, as it were, was called for. But the Vicar remained unwed&#x2014;despite being a rakishly handsome man whose arrival in the village three years ago had had much the impact of a Hugh Grant exiting the elevator as Aretha Franklin sang &#x201c;What you want, baby, I got&#x201d; (Elka was a movie buff). His advent having utterly galvanized the female population, he remained, it was felt, <i>stubbornly</i> unattached despite the concerted best efforts of every woman in Nether Monkslip to corral him for either themselves or a relative. Over time, he tended to be thought of as &#x201c;more in the mold of Tom Hanks,&#x201d; which only leant more to his appeal, and to the frustration of what came to be called, with linguistic inaccuracy, the Anglican Yenta Corps.<br>Only slightly daunted, Suzanna now stood up in her sexy, slip-on heels, her hair artfully tousled, a cruel if unintentional contrast to Wanda&#x2019;s battened-down fa�ade. Aware that most women hated her on sight, or at least regarded her with deep suspicion as having the potential to quickly develop, without careful monitoring, into the village hussy, Suzanna had cultivated in self-defense a genuinely warm and disarming persona. The others watched in awed silence as they realized she was going to engage. It was like watching a sacrificial virgin preparing to fling herself into the mouth of an active volcano.<br>&#x201c;It is not Lily&#x2019;s fault that the vendor let us down,&#x201d; Suzanna said loudly, anticipating Wanda&#x2019;s air-raid siren shout-down. When roused, Suzanna could give as good as she got, and in defense of someone already as downtrodden as Lily, Suzanna could be formidable indeed. Besides, she knew there lingered among the members of the Women&#x2019;s Institute some unresolved feeling, however unwarranted, from the debacle that was the &#x201c;All about Mixing Cocktails!&#x201d; program of earlier in the year. Suzanna, who had suggested the scheme, and felt some ground had been lost in the sound-judgment department, was anxious to shine here.<br>&#x201c;The Fayre this year apparently has been a cock-up all round compared with previous years, but perhaps we could focus efforts on what we should be doing to be ready anyway in one week&#x2019;s time.&#x201d;<br>Wanda, who had drawn a deep, shocked breath on the word &#x201c;cock-up,&#x201d; had not otherwise disturbed the loaded silence of the room. Mme Cuthbert, who operated La Maison Bleue wine and cheese shop with a polished �lan, allowed herself a small moue of approval in Suzanna&#x2019;s direction. The others stared straight ahead, like zombies in a bad sci-fi movie.<br>Finally, Awena Owen, the village&#x2019;s self-proclaimed New-Agey Neopagan, for want of a better description, was emboldened to speak, pushing back her thick dark hair, striking because of its single streak of white over one brow. She stood, feet solidly planted, a vital, comely, and charismatic figure who, although essentially otherworldly, managed to operate her New Age gift shop on a large profit margin. She was well liked and respected by the villagers, who called her the Great White Oprah.<br>&#x201c;I have a few extra chairs in my shop,&#x201d; Awena said now, &#x201c;cluttering up the back room. One needs mending, is all. I&#x2019;d bet the rest of us could have a look in our attics and find something there too. Save us money, anyway, and this <i>is</i> all for charity.&#x201d;<br>Wanda Batton-Smythe found her voice at last.<br>&#x201c;I Know It&#x2019;s For Charity,&#x201d; she bit out, her tone now apocalyptic. She looked like a bishop about to consign the Maid of Orl�ans to the flames. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll have a hodgepodge of furniture in the tea tent that won&#x2019;t match.&#x201d; Her mouth, which she had barely peeled open for speech, now snapped shut in a thin line of distaste, as if Awena had suggested they all ride naked in the fete&#x2019;s pony ride.<br>&#x201c;So?&#x201d; said Awena, not unreasonably.<br>&#x201c;Then that&#x2019;s settled,&#x201d; yelled Suzanna, in triumph this time. She began rootling in her handbag for pencil and paper. &#x201c;If everyone would put down their name and the number of chairs they think they can provide. We&#x2019;ll need tables, too, of course. Now, as to the Bring and Buy...&#x201d;<br>Lily swiveled a brief, grateful glance in her direction, but overall Lily&#x2019;s round brown eyes remained fixed on Wanda&#x2019;s face. It was a sight not without fascination as outrage, frustration, and murderous impulse struggled for supremacy. Wanda seemed to telegraph an unambiguous <i>Fuck you</i> in Suzanna&#x2019;s direction, but when she spoke she had evidently decided to &#x201c;Rise Above It.&#x201d; Cutting across the Bring and Buy chatter, she said, &#x201c;As we seem to have no choice in the matter, due to the incompetence of the person in charge&#x201d; (here she pointed a quivering, outraged finger in Lily&#x2019;s direction, in case anyone remained in doubt about who was to blame), &#x201c;this poor stopgap measure will have to do.&#x201d; She sighed heavily, dissatisfaction puckering her lips. &#x201c;As I am in charge of the Bring and Buy, there is no need ...</p><h2>Tracking Dog: Theory &amp; Methods</h2><p>Johnson presents the basics of tracking work, and leads the reader step-by-step through a planned, easy to follow program, which has resulted in 100% success for his students.

But not Mr. and Mrs. Watson, who think the title of the film<i> </i>is inspirational. And not their beloved Mercy, who is inspired by the fact that the drive-in proudly serves real butter on its Bottomless Bucket of popcorn. So when they pull up in their convertible, Mercy lifts her snout and becomes a pig on a mission &#x2013; for what is more heavenly than being hot on the trail of a true butter smell? Masterful slapstick director Kate DiCamillo sends Mercy on a delirious chase, followed by a trail of hapless rescuers that fans will recognize from prior episodes. And Chris Van Dusen&#x2019;s comic retro illustrations perfectly capture a nostalgic pastime &#x2013; along with the newest antics of a charmingly single-minded pig.</p><p><b>Kate DiCamillo</b>&nbsp;is the author of the first five stories starring Mercy Watson. She is also the author of&nbsp;<i>The Tale of Despereaux,&nbsp;</i>which won the Newbery Medal;&nbsp;<i>Because of Winn-Dixie,</i>&nbsp;which received a Newbery Honor;&nbsp;<i>The Tiger Rising,</i>a National Book Award Finalist;&nbsp;<i>The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane,</i>&nbsp;winner of a&nbsp;<i>Boston Globe-Horn Book&nbsp;</i>Award; and the&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>best-selling picture book&nbsp;<i>Great Joy</i>.

Mr. and Mrs. Watson are sure she'll find it inspirational, but Mercy is more excited by the prospect of real butter on Bottomless Buckets of popcorn. Familiar characters from other adventures&#x2014;Police Officer Tomilello, Animal Control Officer Francine Poulet, and reformed robber Leroy Ninker&#x2014;are also at the Bijou. They leap into action when Mercy, with snout in the air, follows the irresistible scent of butter to waiting cars with windows down. "People screamed. People laughed. People fainted. Mercy kept eating." When the Watsons realize that their porcine wonder is missing, they join the chase, which ends only when two clever firemen catch up to her and suggest a treat of buttered toast. Though no one gets to see the movie, they all eat toast together, which, for Mercy, is a very happy ending. Illustrations are done in gouache using a bright, retro palette of glossy colors, bringing the text vibrantly to life. All of the elements of the earlier stories are here&#x2014;jovial characters, good-humored mayhem, and effortless repetition that moves the story forward while allowing emerging readers to peruse it themselves. Youngsters are sure to delight in the exploits of this butter-loving pig, savoring DiCamillo's "wonky in the extreme" text and Van Dusen's energetic, innocent art.&#x2014;<i>Mary Jean Smith, Southside Elementary School, Lebanon, TN</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It explores how power and resistance&nbsp;might be&nbsp;most effectively and ethically understood and utilised in clinical practice with survivors of trauma. </p> <p><em>Power, Resistance and Liberation in Therapy with Survivors of Trauma</em> draws together narrative therapy, Coordinated Management of Meaning (CMM) and liberation psychology approaches. It critically reviews each approach and demonstrates what each contributes to the other as well as how to draw them together in a coherent way. The book presents:</p> <ul> <p> </p><li>an original take on CMM through the lenses of power and resistance </li> <li>a new way of thinking about resistance in life and therapy, using the metaphor of creativity</li> <li>numerous case examples to support strong theory-practice links. </li> <p></p></ul> <p>Through the exploration of power, resistance and liberation in therapy, this book presents innovative ways of conceptualising these issues. As such it will be of interest to anyone in the mental health fields of therapy, counselling, social work or critical psychology, regardless of their preferred model. It will also appeal to those interested in a socio-political contextual analysis of complex human experience. </p></p><p><p><strong>Taiwo Afuape</strong> is a Principal Clinical Psychologist and Systemic Psychotherapist working in South Camden Community CAMHS for the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust and Principal Systemic Psychotherapist in an adult psychology and psychotherapy service in CNWL NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK&nbsp;</p><p><em>"Innovative and very challenging... not only locating therapy within systemic, political and cultural contexts but also providing much useful clinical advice &#x2013; highly recommended!"</em> - <strong>Professor Eia Asen</strong>, C<strong>linical Director of the Marlborough Family Service, London, and Visiting Professor at University College London, UK</strong></p> <p><em>"Terrific!
